<h2><a id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE.</h2>
</div>

<p>This book is not intended to be a History of Napoleon
the First, but simply to reproduce the bulk of the Caricatures
and Satires published in England on our great
enemy, with as much of history as may help to elucidate
them.</p>

<p>The majority of the caricatures are humorous; others
are silly, or spiteful&mdash;as will occasionally happen nowadays;
and some are too coarse for reproduction&mdash;so that a careful
selection has had to be made. Gillray and Rowlandson
generally signed their names to the work of their hands;
but, wherever a caricature occurs unsigned by the artist,
I have attributed it, on the authority of the late Edward
Hawkins, Esq., some time Keeper of the Prints at the
British Museum, to whatever artist he has assigned it. I
have personally inspected every engraving herein described,
and the description is entirely my own.</p>

<p>Should there, by chance, be an occasional discrepancy
as to a date, it has been occasioned by the inconceivable
contradictions which occur in different histories and newspapers.
To cite an instance: in three different books are
given three different dates of Napoleon leaving Elba, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_vi">vi</a></span>
it was only by the knowledge that it occurred on a Sunday,
and by consulting an almanac for the year 1815, that I was
able absolutely to determine it.</p>

<p>The frontispiece is taken from a very rare print, and
gives a novel view of Napoleon to us, who are always
accustomed to see him represented in military uniform.</p>

<p>That my readers may find some instruction, mingled
with the amusement I have provided for them, is the
earnest wish of</p>

<p>BIRTH AND GENEALOGY&mdash;HIS OWN ACCOUNT&mdash;MAJORCAN OR GREEK
EXTRACTION&mdash;ENGLISH BIOGRAPHIES.</p></blockquote>

<p>Curiously enough, it has never been practically settled
whence the ancestors of Napoleon Bonaparte came. He,
himself, cared little for the pride of birth, and when, during
his Consulate, they manufactured for him a genealogy
descending from a line of kings, he laughed at it, and said
that his patent of nobility dated from the battle of Montenotte.</p>

<p>But, still, one would think he ought to know, for family
tradition is strong; and if it can be trusted, this is his own
account. âOne day Napoleon questioned Canova about
Alfieri, and Canova found an opportunity to render an
important service to Florence, &amp;c. âSire,â said he,
âauthorise the President of the Academy of Florence to
take care of the frescoes and pictures. I heartily wish it.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2">2</a></span>
That will reflect great honour on your Majesty, who, I am
assured, is of a noble Florentine family.â At these words
the Empress (Maria Louisa) turned towards her husband
and said:&mdash;âWhat! are you not Corsican?â âYes,â
replied Napoleon, âbut of Florentine origin.â Canova
then said:&mdash;âThe President of the Academy of Florence,
the Senator Allessandria, is of one of the most illustrious
houses in the country, which has had one of its ladies
married to a Bonaparte, thus you are Italian, and we boast
of it.â âI am, certainly,â added Napoleon.â<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a></p>

<p>Prince Napoleon Louis Bonaparte (brother to the Emperor)
published in 1830, at Florence, a French translation
of an old book<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a> about the sack of Rome, 1527, which gives
an account of the family of the writer. But Majorca also
puts in a claim to the older Bonapartes; and in 1852, Don
Antonio Furio, a learned man, Member of the Royal Academies
of Belles Lettres of Barcelona and Majorca, &amp;c.,
made a declaration as to âthe rank, dignity, and extinction
of the noble family of Bonapart in the island of Majorca;â
and quotes from a book kept in the archives of Palma, in
which are preserved the armorial escutcheons of the noble
families of the Island, the arms of Bonapart&mdash;which were
Dexter, on a field Azure, six stars, Or, placed two by two,
Sinister, on a field gules, a lion rampant, Or; and the Chief
Or, bears a scared eagle, sable. He says the family came
from Genoa to Majorca, in which island its members were
considered noblemen, and they filled several distinguished
offices. In a register of burials relating to knights and
gentlemen, written in 1559, the antiquity and nobility of
the Bonaparts are clearly authenticated; and it would<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3">3</a></span>
seem from Don Furioâs account (for all of which he
gives chapter and verse) that the learned jurisconsult Don
Hugo Bonapart left Majorca and went to Corsica, where,
in 1411, he was made Regent of the Chancery of that
place; and, as he settled there, his name was inscribed in
the Golden Book of France.</p>

<p>This seems pretty circumstantial, until another theory
appears&mdash;namely, his Greek extraction. Sir J. Emerson
Tennent says:<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a> âThere is a story relative to the family
name of the Bonapartes, that somewhat excites curiosity
as to the amount of truth which it may contain. In 1798,
when Napoleon was secretly preparing for his descent upon
Egypt, among other expedients for distracting and weakening
the Porte, French emissaries were clandestinely
employed in exciting the Greeks in Epirus, and the Morea,
to revolt. In Maina especially (the ancient Sparta), these
agents were received with marked enthusiasm, on the
ground that Bonaparte was born in Corsica, where numbers
of Greeks from that part of the Morea had found an
asylum after the conquest of Candia, in 1669, but they
were eventually expelled by the Genoese.</p>

<p>âOne of the persons so employed by Napoleon to rouse
the Greeks in 1798 was named Stephanopoli; and one of
the arguments which he used was, that Napoleon himself
was a Greek in blood, and a Mainote by birth, being
descended from one of the exiles who took refuge at
Ajaccio in 1673. The name of this family, he said, was
Calomeri, ÎÎ±Î»á½¹Î¼ÎµÏÎ¹Ï,<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a> which the Corsicans accommodated
to their own dialect by translating it into <i>Buonaparte</i>.â</p>

<p>Another writer, signing himself <i>Rhodocanakis</i>, in the
same periodical,<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a> says: âI am happy to be able to assert<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4">4</a></span>
with confidence, and on the authority of General Kallergis,
the intimate friend of the present Emperor, of Prince
Pitzipios, and others, that the story devised by Nicholas
Stepanapoulos, and mentioned by his niece, the Duchesse
dâAbrantes, in her <i>Memoirs</i>, that Napoleon was a Greek in
blood, and a Mainote by birth, being descended from the
family of Calomeri, who took refuge at Ajaccio, Corsica,
was never authoritatively denied. On the contrary, both
the first and third Napoleon appeared pleased at the story,
whenever it was alluded to in their presence; probably
because they thought it good policy not to deny what
they might in future wish to turn to their advantage. As
regards the name of ÎÎ±Î»Î¿Î¼á½³ÏÎ·Ï or ÎÎ±Î»á½¹Î¼ÎµÏÎ¿Ï, there are
still many families of that name in Greece.â</p>

<p>Now let us hear what Madame Junot, the aforesaid
Duchesse dâAbrantes, the intimate friend of Napoleon,
whose families were the closest of neighbours at Ajaccio,
says on this subject.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a> âWhen Constantine Comnenus
landed at Corsica in 1676, at the head of a Greek colony,
he had with him several sons, one of whom was named
Calomeros. This son he sent to Florence, on a mission to
the Grand Duke of Tuscany. Constantine dying before
the return of his son, the Grand Duke prevailed on the
young Greek to renounce Corsica, and fix his abode in
Tuscany. After some interval of time, an individual came
from Italy&mdash;indeed from Tuscany&mdash;and fixed his abode in
Corsica, where his descendants formed the family of
Buonaparte; for the name <i>Calomeros</i>, literally Italianised,
signified <i>buona parte</i> or <i>bella parte</i>.<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a></p>

<p>âThe only question is, whether the Calomeros who left<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5">5</a></span>
Corsica, and the Calomeros who came there, have a direct
filiation. Two facts, however, are certain&mdash;namely, the
departure of the one, and the arrival of the other. It is a
singular thing that the Comneni,<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">8</a> in speaking of the Bonaparte
family, always designate them by the names <i>Calomeros</i>,
<i>Calomeri</i>, or <i>Calomeriani</i>, according as they allude to one
individual, or several collectively. Both families were united
by the most intimate friendship.</p>

<p>âWhen the Greeks were obliged to abandon Paomia
to escape the persecutions of the insurgent Corsicans,
they established themselves temporarily in towns which
remained faithful to the Republic of Genoa. When, at a
subsequent period, Cargesa was granted to the Greeks for
the purpose of forming a new establishment, a few Greek
families continued to reside at Ajaccio.â</p>

<p>I have been thus diffuse on his ancestry, because
English satirists could not tell the truth on the subject&mdash;they
were too swayed by the passion of the moment, and
had to pander to the cravings of the mob. Take an
example, from a broad sheet published in 1803, when our
island was in deadly fear of invasion, a âHistory of Buonaparte.â
âNapoleon Buonaparte is the son of a poor lawyer
of Ajaccio, in Corsica, in which city he was born on the
15th of August, 1769. His grandfather, Joseph, originally
a butcher of the same place, was ennobled by Count
Nieuhoff, some time King of Corsica. He was the son of
Carlos Buona, who once kept a liquor shop, or tavern, but
who, being convicted of robbery and murder, was condemned
to the Gallies, where he died in 1724. His wife,
La Birba, the mother of Joseph, died in the House of
Correction at Geneva (? Genoa). On the 3rd May, 1736,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6">6</a></span>
when Porto Vecchio was attacked, Joseph Buona brought
to the assistance of King Theodore a band of vagabonds
which, during the civil war, had chosen him for its leader.
In return, Theodore, on the following day, created him a
noble, and added to his name <i>Buona</i> the termination
<i>PartÃ©</i>. Joseph Buonaparteâs wife <i>Histria</i>, was the daughter
of a journeyman tanner of Bastia, also in Corsica.â</p>

<p>And yet one more, from another equally veracious
âlife.â âBuonaparteâs great-grandfather kept a wine-house
for factors (like our gin shops), and, being convicted of
murder and robbery, he died a galley slave at Genoa, in
1724: his wife was likewise an accomplice, and she died
in the House of Correction at Genoa in 1734. His grandfather
was a butcher of Ajaccio, and his grandmother
daughter of a journeyman tanner at Bastia. His father
was a low petty-fogging lawyer, who served and betrayed
his country by turns, during the Civil Wars. After France
conquered Corsica, he was a spy to the French Government,
and his mother their trull. What is bred in the
bone will not come out of the flesh.â</p>

<p>DESCENT FROM THE MAN IN THE IRON MASK&mdash;ANAGRAMS, ETC., ON HIS
NAME&mdash;THE BEAST OF THE APOCALYPSE&mdash;HIS MOTHERâS ACCOUNT
OF HIS BIRTH.</p></blockquote>

<p>The foregoing was the sort of stuff given to our grandfathers
for history; nothing could be bad enough for
Boney, <i>the Corsican Ogre</i>&mdash;nay, they even tortured his
name to suit political purposes. It was hinted that the
keeper of âthe Man with the Iron Mask,â who was said to be
no other than the twin (and elder) brother of Louis XIV.,
was named <i>Bon part</i>; that the said keeper had a daughter,
with whom the Man in the Mask fell in love, and to whom
he was privately married; that their children received
their motherâs name, and were secretly conveyed to Corsica,
where the name was converted into <i>Bonaparte</i>, or
<i>Buonaparte</i>; and that one of these children was the
ancestor of Napoleon Bonaparte, who was thus entitled to
be recognised, not only as of French origin, but as the
direct descendant of the rightful heir to the throne of
France.</p>

<p>They put his name into Greek, and tortured it <span class="locked">thus:&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>Napoleon, Apoleon, Poleon, Oleon, Leon, Eon, On,</p>

<p>ÎÎ±ÏÎ¿Î»ÎµÏÎ½, ÎÏÎ¿Î»ÎµÏÎ½, Î Î¿Î»ÎµÏÎ½, ÎÎ»ÎµÏÎ½, ÎÎµÏÎ½, ÎÏÎ½, Î©Î½,</p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">which sentence will translate, âNapoleon, being the lion of
the nations, went about destroying cities.â</p>

<p>In the âJournal des DÃ©bats,â 8 Avril, 1814, although
not an English satire on his name, it is gravely stated that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8">8</a></span>
he was baptised by the name of Nicholas, and that he
assumed the name of Napoleon as an uncommon one; but
this name, Nicholas, which was applied to him so freely
in France, was but a cant term for a stupid blockhead.
Whilst on this subject, however, I cannot refrain from
quoting a passage from a French book: âI do not know
what fellow has held that <i>Napolione</i> was a demon, who in
bygone times, amused himself by tormenting a poor imbecile.
The fellow can not have read the life of the Saints:
he would then have learned that St. Napolione, whose
name is given at length in the legend, is as good a patron
as any other; that he performed seven miracles during his
life, and twenty-two and a half after his death&mdash;for he had
not time to finish the twenty-third; it was an unfortunate
tiler who, in falling from a roof, broke both his legs. St.
Napoleon had already set one, when an unlucky doctor
prescribed some medicine to the sick man which carried
him off to the other world.â<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a></p>

<p>There is an extremely forcible acrostic in Latin on his
name, which deserves <span class="locked">reproduction:&mdash;</span></p>

But not only was his name thus made a vehicle for
political purposes, but the expounders of prophecy got
hold of it, and found out, to their great delight, that at
last they had got that theological bugbear, <i>the Apocalyptic
beast</i>. Nothing could be clearer. It could be proved to
demonstration, most simply and clearly. Every one had

<p class="p2 center"><i>Verse 1st.</i></p>

<blockquote>
<p>âAnd a Beast rose out of the Sea, having ten crowns on his
head,â &amp;c.</p></blockquote>

<p>This Beast is supposed to mean Buonaparte, he being born in
<i>Corsica</i>, which is an island, and having conquered ten kingdoms.</p>

<p class="p2 center"><i>Verse 5th.</i></p>

<blockquote>

<p>âAnd a mouth was given him speaking blasphemies; and
power given him upon the earth, forty and two months.â</p></blockquote>

<p>Buonaparte was crowned in December, 1804; it is therefore
supposed the <i>extent</i> of his assumed power upon earth will now be
limited, this present month (<i>June</i>) 1808, being exactly the forty-second
month of his reign.</p>

<p class="p2 center"><i>Verse 16th.</i></p>

<blockquote>

<p>âAnd he caused all to receive a mark in their hands, and no
one could buy or sell, save those that had the mark of the Beast.â</p></blockquote>

<p>To persons conversant in commercial affairs, these verses need
no comment. There are, at present, some of <i>these marks</i> to be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10">10</a></span>
seen in this country; they had the Crown of Italy, &amp;c., at top,
and are signed âBuonaparte,â âTalleyrandâ; and all of them are
numbered.</p>

<p class="p2 center"><i>Verse 18th.</i></p>

<blockquote>

<p>âLet him that hath understanding, count the number of the
Beast, for it is the number of a man, and his number is <span class="smcap">Six
hundred, Sixty and Six</span>.â</p></blockquote>

<p>This verse is curious, and should be read attentively. The
method of using letters for figures at the time the Revelations
were written is proved by many monuments of Roman antiquity
now extant.</p>

<p>The above verses are not the only parts of the chapter which
have reference to Buonaparte, but the <i>most prominent ones</i>; the
connection throughout has been clearly ascertained.</p></blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>In a curious little book called <i>The Corsicanâs Downfall</i>,
by a Royal Arch Mason, published at Mansfield in
1814, at p. 6, it says, with reference to the numeration,
âThe oldest treatise on the theory of arithmetic is comprised
in the seventh, eighth, and ninth books of Euclidâs
<i>Elements</i>, about two hundred and eighty years before the
Christian era. The first author of any consequence who
used the modern way of computing by figures, instead
of letters of the alphabet, was Jordanus of Namur, who
flourished about 1200; and his arithmetic was afterwards
published and demonstrated by Johannis Faber Stapulensis,
in the fifteenth century. The name, then, and number of
the Beast must be discovered (if at all) by the ancient
method of computation in use at the time when the prophecies
were written.â</p>

<p>But Bonaparte ungratefully refused to fulfil prophecy
by being destroyed at the end of forty-two months, <i>i.e.</i> in
June 1808, which must have put the expositors on their
mettle. They were, however, fully equal to the occasion,
and ingeniously solved the quotation this way.<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">11</a> âPower
was given unto him to continue forty-and-two months:
now it is well known that he was self created, or crowned
Emperor of France, on the 2nd day of December 1804,
and that he reigned in full power and authority over the
prostrate States upon the Continent until the 2nd day of
May 1808, the very day on which the gallant Patriots of
Spain made so noble and glorious a struggle to throw off
the abominable yoke that he had imposed upon them,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12">12</a></span>
which is exactly a period of three years and a half, or
forty two months.â</p>

<p>An ingenious lunatic, named L. Mayer, found out
another way of fathering the Mark of the Beast upon
Napoleon. He took the number of sovereigns who had
reigned in Europe until Napoleonâs arrival&mdash;some he has
left out to suit his convenience, but that is a trivial matter&mdash;the
case had to be made out against the unfortunate
Emperor.</p>

<p>Mr. Urban,&mdash;The following singular coincidences may furnish
matter for reflection to the curious. It has been generally admitted
that the Roman Empire, after passing under <i>seven</i> different forms
of government (or <i>seven</i> heads), was divided into <i>ten</i> kingdoms in
Europe (the ten horns of Daniel and John); and that, notwithstanding<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13">13</a></span>
the various changes Europe has undergone, the number
of kingdoms was generally about ten.</p>

<p>It is not a little surprising that the <i>Heads of the Family of

<p>And in his name is contained the name given by John to the
King of the Locusts, who is called âApoleon,â or âthe Destroyer.â</p></blockquote>

<p>Even the date of his birth was disputed, for some said
he was born on February 5, 1768&mdash;in his marriage registry
it is the same, and he used to tell De Bourrienne, his school-fellow,
that he was born on August 15, 1769, and it is so
noted in the registry of his entrance into the military school
at Brienne in 1779, and the Ecole Militaire in 1784, besides
being the date used in all documents necessary to his promotion.
But probably his mother knew somewhat about<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14">14</a></span>
it, and Madame Junot says,<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">13</a> speaking of Madame LÃ¦titia
Bonaparte, âI recollect she this day told us that, being at
Mass on the day of the fÃªte of Notre Dame of August, she
was overtaken by the pains of childbirth, and she had
hardly reached home when she was delivered of <i>Napoleon</i>,
on a wretched rug.... I know not why,â said she, âit has
been reported that Paoli was Napoleonâs godfather. It is
not true; Laurent JiubÃ©ga<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">14</a> was his godfather. He held

FAMILY&mdash;EARLY PERSONAL DESCRIPTION OF NAPOLEON&mdash;HIS OWN
ACCOUNT OF HIMSELF&mdash;SATIRISTSâ NARRATION OF HIS SCHOOL-DAYS.</p></blockquote>

<p>In after life, when Napoleon was successful, and had made
a position, reports were spread that his real father was
Count MarbÅuf, who had been in Corsica, and in after life,
or at all events at his entrance into it, acted as his benefactor
and patron. LÃ¦titia Ramolini, afterwards Madame
LÃ¦titia Bonaparte, was very graceful and pretty, indeed
Madame Junot says of her,<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">16</a> âLÃ¦titia was indeed a lovely
woman. Those who knew her in advanced life thought
her countenance somewhat harsh; but that expression
instead of being caused by any austerity of disposition,
seemed, on the contrary, to have been produced by
timidity.â Indeed, no one can look at any portrait
of Madame MÃ¨re, and not be struck with her lofty
beauty.</p>

<p>This scandal about Count MarbÅuf, it must be remembered,
is of French origin, and was well known, and
recognised, probably, at its value. To give one illustration,<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">17</a>
âLa malignitÃ© a fait honneur de sa naissance au Comte de

<p>The Bonaparte family was not rich, their sole means of
living being from the fatherâs professional exertions, and
the family was very large, and many mouths to feed; in
fact, they were in somewhat straitened circumstances, but
not in such squalid poverty as Gillray depicts them, in the
accompanying illustration, where our hero may be seen,
with his brothers and sisters, gnawing the <i>bony part</i> of a
shin of beef.</p>

<p>Madame Junot<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">19</a> says, âSaveria told me that Napoleon
was never a pretty boy, as Joseph had been; his head
always appeared too large for his body, a defect common
to the Bonaparte family. When Napoleon grew up, the
peculiar charm of his countenance lay in his eye, especially
in the mild expression it assumed in his moments of kindness.
His anger, to be sure, was frightful, and though I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18">18</a></span>
am no coward, I never could look at him in his fits of rage
without shuddering. Though his smile was captivating,
yet the expression of his mouth when disdainful, or angry,
could scarcely be seen without terror. But that forehead
which seemed formed to bear the crowns of a whole world;
those hands, of which the most coquettish woman might
have been vain, and whose white skin covered muscles of
iron; in short, of all that personal beauty which distinguished
Napoleon as a young man, no traces were discernible in
the boy.â</p>

<p>Napoleon said of himself: âI was an obstinate and inquisitive
child. I was extremely headstrong; nothing
overawed me, nothing disconcerted me. I made myself
formidable to the whole family. My brother Joseph was
the one with whom I was oftenest embroiled; he was bitten,
beaten, abused: I went to complain before he had time to
recover his confusion.â</p>

<p>NAPOLEON AT THE ECOLE MILITAIRE&mdash;PERSONAL DESCRIPTION&mdash;<i>PUSS IN
BOOTS</i>&mdash;VISIT TO CORSICA&mdash;SOLICITS SERVICE IN ENGLAND&mdash;REPORTED
VISIT TO LONDON&mdash;SIEGE OF TOULON.</p></blockquote>

<p>On October 14 or 17, 1784, he left Brienne for the Ecole
Militaire at Paris.</p>

<p>Gillray, when he drew the picture (on next page) of the
abject, ragged, servile-looking Napoleon, could hardly have
realised the fact that Napoleon was then over fifteen years
of age, and that, having been already five years at a military
school, he must necessarily have carried himself in a more
soldierly manner. He stayed at the Ecole Militaire till
August 1875, when he obtained his brevet of second lieutenant
of Artillery in the regiment of La FÃ¨re. Madame
Junot<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">20</a> tells an amusing anecdote of him at this period,
which I must be pardoned introducing here, as it helps us
to imagine his personal appearance. âI well recollect that
on the day when he first put on his uniform, he was as vain
as young men usually are on such an occasion. There was
one part of his dress which had a very droll appearance&mdash;that
was his boots. They were so high and wide, that his
little thin legs seemed buried in their amplitude. Young
people are always ready to observe anything ridiculous;
and, as soon as my sister and I saw Napoleon enter the
drawing-room, we burst into a loud fit of laughter. At that
early age, as well as in after life, Bonaparte could not relish
a joke; and when he found himself the object of merriment,
he grew angry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23">23</a></span></p>

<p class="smaller">Bonaparte when a boy received throâ the Kingâs bounty into the
Ecole Militaire at Paris.</p></div></div>

<p>âMy sister, who was some years older than I, told him
that since he wore a sword he ought to be gallant to ladies;
and, instead of being angry, should be happy that they
joked with him. âYou are nothing but a child&mdash;a little
<i>pensionnaire</i>,â said Napoleon, in a tone of contempt. Cecile,
who was twelve or thirteen years of age, was highly indignant
at being called a child, and she hastily resented the
affront by replying to Bonaparte, âAnd you are nothing
but a <i>puss in boots</i>.â This excited a general laugh among
all present, except Napoleon, whose rage I will not attempt
to describe. Though not much accustomed to society, he
had too much tact not to perceive that he ought to be silent
when personalities were introduced, and his adversary was
a woman.</p>

<p>âThough deeply mortified at the unfortunate nickname
which my sister had given him, yet he affected to forget it;
and to prove that he cherished no malice on the subject,
he got a little toy made, and gave it to me. This toy consisted
of a cat in boots, in the character of a footman running<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24">24</a></span>
before the carriage of the Marquis de Carabas. It
was very well made, and must have been rather expensive
to him considering his straitened finances. He brought
along with it a pretty little edition of the popular tale of
<i>Puss in Boots</i>, which he presented to my sister, begging her
to keep it as a <i>token of his remembrance</i>.â</p>

<p>Napoleon afterwards frequently called Junot, <i>Marquis
de Carabas</i>, and, on one occasion, Madame Junot, in badinage,
reminded Napoleon of his present to her, at which he
got very angry.</p>

<p>During his sub-lieutenancy he was very poor, yet he
managed to go to Corsica for six months, whilst Paoli, who
had been living in England, was there. There is a curious
idea that, about this time (mentioned in more places than
one<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">21</a>), he applied for service under the British Government.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25">25</a></span></p><div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">At this time Bonaparte scarce knew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What for his maintenance to do&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So he sat down, and quickly wrote<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A very condescending note,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(Althoâ a wretched scrawl when written),<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which to a Chieftain of Great Britain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He, soon as possible, dispatchâd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In which he swore he was attachâd<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unto the British Constitution,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And therefore formâd the resolution<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of fighting in that countryâs cause,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For George the Third, and for his laws,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If that his services were needed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And to his wishes they acceded.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It seems that Bonaparte could trade well,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Heâd fight for any one that paid well;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But he a disappointment got,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Because his services were not<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By Britainâs chief Commander tried;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The rank he sought for was denied.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This was the cause of great displeasure,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It mortified him above measure,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he gave England now as many a<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Curse, as before he eâer gave Genoa.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Nay, more extraordinary than all, it was even pretended
that he lived some time in England. The <i>Birmingham
Journal</i> of April 21, 1855, affirms, on the authority of Mr.
J. Coleman of the Strand, who is now 104 years of age,
and whose portrait and biographical sketch appeared in
the <i>Illustrated London News</i>, Feb. 1850, and who knew perfectly
well M. Bonaparte, who, while he lived in London,
which was for five weeks, in 1791 or 1792, lodged in a house
in George Street, Strand, and whose chief occupation appeared
to be taking pedestrian exercise in the streets of
London. Hence his marvellous knowledge of the great
metropolis, which used to astonish any Englishmen of
distinction, who were not aware of the visit. I have also
heard Mr. Matthews, the grandfather of the celebrated
comedian, Mr. Thomas Goldsmith of the Strand, Mr.
Graves, Mr. Drury, and my father, all of whom were tradesmen
in the Strand, in the immediate vicinity of George
Street, speak of this visit. He occasionally took his cup
of chocolate at the Northumberland, occupying himself in
reading, and preserving a provoking taciturnity to the
gentlemen in the room; though his manner was stern, his
deportment was that of a gentleman.â</p>

<p>Timbs<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">22</a> endorses this statement, in identically the same
words of a portion of the above, which he fathers on old
Mr. Matthews, the bookseller in the Strand, but we must
recollect that Mr. Timbs was writing the â<i>Romance</i> of
London.â</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26">26</a></span>
A personal description of Napoleon in 1793 may be
interesting, especially as it comes from a trustworthy pen.<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">23</a>
âAt that period of his life Bonaparte was decidedly ugly;
he afterwards underwent a total change. I do not speak
of the illusive charm which his glory spread around him,
but I mean to say that a gradual physical change took
place in him in the space of seven years. His emaciated
thinness was converted into a fulness of face, and his complexion,
which had been yellow, and apparently unhealthy,
became clear and comparatively fresh; his features, which
were angular and sharp, became round and filled out. As
to his smile, it was always agreeable. The mode of dressing
his hair, which has such a droll appearance as we see
it in the prints of the bridge of Arcola, was then comparatively
simple, for young men of fashion (the <i>Muscadins</i>),
whom he used to rail at so loudly at that time, wore their
hair very long. But he was very careless of his personal
appearance; and his hair, which was ill-combed and ill-powdered,
gave him the look of a sloven. His little hands,
too, underwent a great metamorphosis: when I first saw
him, they were thin, long, and dark; but he was subsequently
vain of the beauty of them, and with good reason.</p>

<p>âIn short, when I recollect Napoleon entering the
courtyard of the Hotel de la TranquillitÃ© in 1793, with a
shabby round hat drawn over his forehead, and his ill-powdered
hair hanging over the collar of his great-coat,
which afterwards became as celebrated as the white plume
of Henry IV., without gloves, because he used to say they
were an useless luxury, with boots ill-made and ill-blackened,
with his thinness and his sallow complexion; in
fine, when I recollect him at that time, and think what he
was afterwards, I do not see the same man in the two
pictures.â</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27">27</a></span>
He was fortunate in obtaining a higher rank in the
army, being promoted to be commandant of artillery, and
he joined the army besieging Toulon on September 12,
1793. He found his chief, General Cartaux, incompetent,
and, from representations made to Paris, Cartaux was superseded.
There was very hard fighting at Toulon before it
was taken, Admiral Hood, and General OâHara, commanding
the British forces. The latter being taken prisoner,
much disheartened the English, but, at the final assault,
when the town was retaken by the French, the English and
Spanish gunners died fighting at their posts.</p>

<p>For the capture of Toulon, Bonaparte was speedily promoted;
indeed, his superior officer, Dugommier, in his
report, said, âReward and advance this young man, otherwise
he will find means to advance himself.â</p>

<p>He afterwards joined the army at Nice, and was sent
on a secret diplomatic mission to Genoa; on his return
from which he was arrested and thrown into prison, where
he remained a fortnight before he obtained his release.
He was without any employment during the remainder
of 1794, and till the autumn of 1795. He was then in
very poor circumstances financially, and Madame Junot
gives a graphic picture of his distress at this time.<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">24</a>
âBonaparteâs servant informed Mariette that the general

is lucky at play, the largest share of his winnings is always
for his general. The aide-de-campâs family sometimes

was Junot, who got a commission after Toulon.</p>

<p>This is the satiristâs account of the revolt of the Sections,
and Bonaparteâs part therein. When applied to,
he accepted the command, but declared that he must act
untrammelled, and not like Menon, who failed through
having three representatives of the people to counsel him.
This was agreed to, and Barras was chosen chief, with
Napoleon under him. The insurgents numbered some
40,000, the troops but 7,000; and such was the moderation
of the latter, that when the insurrection was quelled,
there were but seventy or eighty of the people killed, and
between three and four hundred wounded.</p>

<p>He was then made General of the Interior, and consequently
Governor of Paris, and this position led him more
into society.</p>

<p>It is now that we come to a great epoch in his life, his
meeting with Josephine, which came about in a somewhat
singular manner. At one of his levÃ©es, a boy of twelve
years, or so, called upon him. The lad was EugÃ¨ne de
Beauharnais, son of a general of the Republic, who was
executed a few days before the death of Robespierre, and
his errand was to petition Napoleon that his fatherâs sword
might be given to him. To quote Napoleonâs own words,
âI was so touched by this affectionate request, that I
ordered it to be given to him. On seeing the sword he
burst into tears: I felt so affected by his conduct, that I
noticed and praised him much. A few days afterwards,
his mother came to return me a visit of thanks; I was
struck with her appearance, and still more with her <i>esprit</i>.â
He was always meeting her in society, especially at
Barrasâs house; and this intimacy, ripening into affection,
brought about their marriage. The following series of
eight plates, illustrating her life, were drawn by Woodward.</p>

<p>Josephine (Marie Josephine Rose de la Pagerie) was
born at Martinique, according to De Bourrienne, on June 23,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33">33</a></span>
1763, but others say it was the same day of the month,
only four years later. She was the daughter of a planter
in that island, and was a Creole, <i>i.e.</i> one born in a French
West Indian settlement. She was fourteen years old when
she was brought to France by her father, and being very
graceful and pretty, it was not long before she was married,
which was to the Vicomte de Beauharnais, on December
13, 1779. The union was not at first a happy one.
She went to Martinique, to see her mother, and stayed
there about fifteen months. Her husband was a general
in the army of the Rhine, but was singled out by Robespierre
as a victim of his tyranny, was imprisoned and
beheaded. Josephine was also imprisoned, and it was at
La Force that she met with Madame Tallien&mdash;âNÃ´tre
Dame de Thermidor,â as ArsÃ¨ne Houssaye calls her&mdash;who
was also in prison. Here, uncertain as to their fate, the
female prisoners played at mock trials and executions (for
the trials always ended in condemnation), and day by day
their numbers grew less, as they were taken away to the
real tragedy which they had rehearsed. Scandal (French<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34">34</a></span>
before it became English) says that Barras, smitten by her
charms, had her released on condition that she became his
mistress. Here is one French account:<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">25</a> âA cette Ã©poque,
la jeune veuve du malheureux vicomte de Beauharnais,

liÃ©e avec Hoche, elle le pria de parler pour elle Ã 
Barras, alors tout-puissant. Celui-ci ne connaissait la vicomtesse
que de rÃ©putation; il voulut la voir, et lui rendit
visite dans sa prison.... Barras, sÃ©duit par la conversation
et les charmes personnels de la jeune veuve, devint, Ã 
la premiÃ¨re visite, et son protecteur, et son ami. Deux
jours aprÃ¨s, elle fut rendue Ã  la libertÃ©.â</p>

<p>That Josephine gave rise to this scandal, is probably
owing to her intimacy with Madame Tallien and Barras.
Barras, she was bound to be grateful to, for by his means,
a part of her husbandâs property was restored to her; but
it was Tallien who, at his wifeâs entreaty, obtained the
liberty, both of Josephine and Duchesse dâAiguillon.
Madame Tallienâs receptions were the most brilliant in
Paris, where the prettiest and wittiest women met the men
most distinguished in any way, and common gratitude,
at least, would have led Josephine to the assemblies of her
dear friend, who had shared her imprisonment, and obtained
her release.</p>

<p>JOSEPHINEâS DRESS AND PERSONAL APPEARANCE&mdash;HER REPUTED CONNECTION
WITH BARRAS&mdash;MARRIAGE WITH NAPOLEON&mdash;HER TASTES
AND DISPOSITION.</p></blockquote>

<p>Let us for a moment, as an antidote to the caricaturistâs
pictures, see what was Josephineâs dress at this period.<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">26</a>
âHere is Madame de Beauharnais, that excellent Josephine,
whose heart is not made for coquetry, but who throws a
childish joy into her dress. With an air less dramatic and
superb than her rivals,<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">27</a> the joyous and kindly creole is,
perhaps, the most French of the three, Madame Tallien is
the most Greek, and Madame Viconti the most Roman.
Josephine wears a wavy dress, rose and white from top
to bottom, with a train trimmed at the bottom with
black bugles, a bodice six fingers deep, and wearing no
<i>fichu</i>; short sleeves of black gauze, long gloves covering
the elbow of <i>noisette</i> colour, which suits this beautiful
violet so well; shoes of yellow morocco; white stockings
with green clocks. If her hair is dressed after the
Etruscan manner, ornamented with cherry-coloured ribbons,
I am sure it is impossible to approach nearer to
the antique. To tempt the fashion is the sole ambition
of the pretty Josephine, but it happens that the celebrated
Madame de Beauharnais sets it.â</p>

<p>It is impossible to quit this subject without some<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37">37</a></span>
contemporary quotations, as they help us to realise the
truth, or falsehood, of the caricaturist.<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">28</a> âMadame Tallien
was kind and obliging, but such is the effect on the multitude
of a name that bears a stain, that her cause was
never separated from that of her husband. The following
is a proof of this. Junot was the bearer of the second
flags, which were sent from the army of Italy to the
Directory. He was received with all the pomp which
attended the reception of Marmont, who was the bearer of
the first colours. Madame Bonaparte, who had not yet set
out to join Napoleon, wished to witness the ceremony;
and, on the day appointed for the reception of Junot she
repaired to the Directory, accompanied by Madame Tallien.
They lived at that time in great intimacy; the latter
was a fraction of the Directorial royalty with which
Josephine, when Madame Beauharnais, and, indeed, after
she became Madame Bonaparte, was in some degree
invested. Madame Bonaparte was still a fine woman;
her teeth, it is true, were already frightfully decayed, but
when her mouth was closed she looked, especially at a
little distance, both young and pretty. As to Madame
Tallien, she was then in the full bloom of her beauty.
Both were dressed in the antique style, which was then
the prevailing fashion, and with as much of richness
and ornament as were suitable to morning costume. When
the reception was ended, and they were about to leave the
Directory, it may be presumed that Junot was not a little
proud to offer to escort these two charming women. Junot
was then a handsome young man of five and twenty, and
he had the military look and style for which, indeed, he
was always remarkable. A splendid uniform of a colonel
of huzzars set off his fine figure to the utmost advantage.
When the ceremony was ended, he offered one arm to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38">38</a></span>
Madame Bonaparte, who as his generalâs wife was entitled
to the first honour, especially on that solemn day; and offering
his other arm to Madame Tallien, he conducted them
down the staircase of the Luxembourg. The crowd stepped
forward to see them as they passed along. âThat is the
generalâs wife,â said one. âThat is his aide de camp,â said
another. âHe is very young.â âShe is very pretty.&mdash;<i>Vive
le General Bonaparte!&mdash;Vive la Citoyenne Bonaparte!</i> She
is a good friend to the poor.â âAh!â exclaimed a great
fat market woman, âShe is <i>Notre Dame des Victoires</i>!â
âYou are right,â said another, âand see who is on the other
side of the officer; that is <i>Notre Dame de Septembre</i>!â
This was severe and it was also unjust.â</p>

<p>We must not trust to the caricaturistâs portrait of Josephine.
She was good looking and graceful then, but, afterwards,
she did become very stout. We must never forget
in looking over the folios of caricatures of this period, that
the idea of caricaturing then was to exaggerate everything,
and make it grotesque; it is only of modern years that the
refinement of a Leech, Tenniel, or Proctor, gives us caricature
without vulgarity.</p>

<p>After seeing Josephine as she really was, it will be worth
while to compare the satiristâs idea of her, and her marriage
with Napoleon.</p>

<p>The pictorial caricaturist, Gillray, gives us February 20,
1805, âCi-devant occupations, or Madame Tallien, and the
Empress Josephine Dancing Naked before Barras, in the
Winter of 1797&mdash;a fact.â<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">29</a></p>

<p>At the foot of this etching, which depicts the sensual
<i>bon viveur</i>, Barras, looking on at the lascivious dancing of
his two mistresses, Madame Tallien and Josephine, it says:
âBarras (then in power), being tired of Josephine, promised
Bonaparte a promotion, on condition that he would take<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41">41</a></span>
her off his hands. Barras had, as usual, drank freely, and
placed Bonaparte behind a screen, while he amused himself
with these two ladies, who were then his humble dependents.
Madame Tallien is a beautiful woman, tall and
elegant. Josephine is smaller, and thin, with bad teeth
something like cloves. It is needless to add that Bonaparte
accepted the promotion, and the lady, now Empress
of France!â</p>

<p>Barre, who notoriously wrote against Napoleon, says:<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">30</a>
âAnd not satisfied by procuring him a splendid appointment,
he made him marry his mistress, the Countess de
Beauharnais, a rich widow, with several children; and who,
although about twenty years older than Bonaparte, was a
very valuable acquisition to a young man without any
fortune. The reputation of the Countess de Beauharnais
was well established, even before the Revolution: but
Buonaparte had not the least right to find fault with a
woman presented to him by Barras.â</p>

<p>At all events they were married, and here is G. Cruikshankâs
idea of the ceremony, and here, also, he depicts the
bridesmaids and groomsmen.</p>

<div id="ip_41" class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
  <img src="images/i_041.jpg" width="600" height="232" alt="" /></div>

<p>Their honeymoon was of the shortest, for De Bourrienne<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42">42</a></span>
says: âHe remained in Paris only ten days after his marriage,
which took place on the 9th of March, 1796.
Madame Bonaparte possessed personal graces and many
good qualities. I am convinced that all who were acquainted
with her must have felt bound to speak well of her; to few,
indeed, did she ever give cause for complaint. Benevolence
was natural to her, but she was not always prudent in its
exercise. Hence her protection was often extended to persons
who did not deserve it. Her taste for splendour and
expense was excessive. This proneness to luxury became
a habit which seemed constantly indulged without any
motive. What scenes have I not witnessed when the
moment for paying the tradesmenâs bills arrived! She
always kept back one half of their claims, and the discovery
of this exposed her to new reproaches. How many tears
did she shed, which might easily have been spared!â</p>

<p>We here see the caricaturistâs idea of Josephine as a
French generalâs wife.</p>

<p>Napoleon now waxed great. Through Barrasâ influence
he was made Commander in Chief of the army of Italy, and
bade adieu to his wife after the very brief period of conjugal

<p>Barre says: âThe campaign in Italy was extremely
brilliant, and withal revolutionary. Buonaparte attributed
all the glory almost exclusively to himself. His secretary,
who wrote his despatches, did it so as to flatter the
generals and the army, but still as if all the merit belonged
to the commander-in-chief. It seems that General Berthier
made a bargain with Buonaparte, to whom he sold
his talents for the sake of becoming rich without any
responsibility. When Buonaparte was raised by the mixed
faction, he made Berthier Minister of War; and in that
capacity he has shown himself more rapacious than any of
his predecessors. Every contractor is obliged to give him
<i>one hundred thousand livres</i> as a present (<i>pot de vin</i>) without
which there is no contract.â He tells a story which
bears somewhat on the above. âIt happened once, that
whilst he was playing at cards, having General Massena
for his partner, that general made a mistake; when Buonaparte
started, all of a sudden, in a violent passion, and
exclaimed, <i>SacrÃ© Dieu! General, you make me lose</i>. But
General Massena instantly retorted with a happy sarcasm:
<i>Be easy, General, remember that I often make you win</i>.
Buonaparte could never forget nor forgive that <i>bon mot</i>.â

<p>It is impossible to pass over in silence an event which
happened in 1796, in which, although Napoleon was not
personally interested, all England was. This was no less
than an attempted invasion of Ireland by the French;
relying on being supported by the Irish, who were disaffected
then, as now. The expedition failed, although it
was numerous and well-found, having General Hoche and
25,000 men with it. By defective seamanship, many of
the ships were damaged, and a 74 gun ship, the <i>Seduisant</i>,
was totally lost. Only one division, commanded by
Admiral Bouvet, reached Ireland, but anchored in Bantry
Bay, where they did nothing, but speedily weighed anchor,
and returned to France. The following is an official letter
on the <span class="locked">subject:&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p class="sigright">

Dublin Castle, December 29, 1796.
</p>

<p>My Lord<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">33</a>&mdash;The last accounts from General Dalrymple are by
his aide-de-camp, Captain Gordon, who left Bantry at ten oâclock
<span class="smcap smaller">A.M.</span> on Tuesday, and arrived here this morning. Seventeen sail
of French ships were at that time at anchor on the lower part of
Bear island, but at such a distance that their force could not be
ascertained. A lieutenant of a French frigate was driven on shore
in his boat, in attempting to quit his vessel, which was dismasted,
to the admiral. He confirms the account of the fleet being
French, with hostile views to this country, but does not appear to
know whether the whole fleet, which consisted of about 17 sail of
the line, 15 frigates, and including transports and luggers, amounted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47">47</a></span>
to fifty sail, were all to re-assemble off Bantry. General Hoche
was on board, commanding a considerable force. I have the
honour to be, my lord,</p>

<p class="sigright">
<span class="l2">Your lordshipâs most obedient servant,</span><br />
<span class="smcap">T. Pelham</span>.
</p></blockquote>

<p>Just let us glance for one moment at the social position
of England at that time. For the first three months of
the year the quartern loaf was 1<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i>; in April it fell to
10<i>d.</i>: in June it rose to 11<i>d.</i>; in September it fell to 8Â¼<i>d.</i>;
at which it remained all the year. There was a surplus of
revenue over expenditure of over twenty-three millions,
which must have gratified the Chancellor of the Exchequer;
the exports exceeded those in 1795 by 1,781,297<i>l.</i>,
and the London Brewers brewed 142,700 more barrels of
porter than the previous year; 3 per cent. Consols varied
from 71 in January (the highest price) to 56-3/8 in December
(nearly their lowest).</p>

<p>At the siege of Mantua, WÃ¼rmser sent his aide-de-camp
Klenau to Napoleon to treat for terms of peace. G. Cruikshank
depicts the scene. Klenau is brought in blindfolded,
and Bonaparte, surrounded by his guard, strikes a melodramatic
attitude, worthy of a pirate captain at a transpontine
theatre.</p>

<p>The real facts are thus described by Horn. âMantua
was now without hope of relief. The hospitals were
crowded, the provisions exhausted; but WÃ¼rmser still
held out. Napoleon informed him of the rout and dispersion
of the Austrian army, and summoned him to surrender.
The old soldier proudly replied that âhe had provisions for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50">50</a></span>
a year;â but a few days afterwards he sent his aide-de-camp,
Klenau, to the head-quarters of Serrurier to treat for
a surrender.</p>

<p>âAt the conference, a French officer sat apart from the
two others, wrapped in his cloak, but within hearing of
what passed. After the discussion was finished, this officer
came forward and wrote marginal answers to the conditions
proposed by WÃ¼rmser; granting terms far more favourable
than those which might have been exacted in the
extremity to which the veteran was reduced. âThese,â
said the unknown officer, giving back the paper, âare
the terms that I grant, if he opens his gates to-morrow;
and if he delays a fortnight, a month, or two months, he
shall have the same terms. He may hold out to his last
morsel of bread; to-morrow I pass the Po and march upon
Rome.â Klenau, recognising Napoleon, and struck with
the generosity of the conditions he had granted, owned
that only three daysâ provisions remained in Mantua.â</p>

<p>The earliest English caricature of Napoleon that I have
met with, was published on April 14, 1797, all those hitherto
given, being of later date. It is not worth reproducing,
as the artist had evidently no knowledge of what manner
of man Napoleon was. It is called the âFrench Bugabo<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">34</a>
frightening the Royal Commanders.â Bonaparte (a perfectly
fanciful, and horrible sketch) is seated on the back of
some impossible Saurian&mdash;meant, probably, for the devil&mdash;who
is vomiting armies and cannon. He calls out, âEgad,
they run well. Courez donc Messieurs les Princes!!!â
Of the two royal commanders running away, Frederick
Duke of York is calling out to his companion, âI wish I
was at York. Come on, Charles, follow me.â Fox, who
acts the part of âthe sweet little cherub that sits up aloft,â
says, âRun, Frederick, run Charles, Mack, Wurmsell, Kell;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51">51</a></span>
well done DâAlvinzi, now Davidovich.â The poor Pope is
being trodden under the beast, and cries out, âOh Lord!
this rebel son of mine pays me no homage whatever.â</p>

<p>Of all the attempts of the French to invade England,
perhaps the most ludicrous was that which took place in
February 1797. On the 22nd of that month, a French
corvette, and a lugger, made for the coast of Pembrokeshire,
and there landed some 1,200 men. Two days after, they
surrendered to Lord Cawdor, and were sent to Haverfordwest:
but, before the arrival of the military, the peasants
attacked them with rough weapons, such as pikes and
scythes. The ships, which brought this invading army over,
were captured on their return to Brest. The following is an
official letter to the Lord Mayor, respecting the <span class="locked">event:&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>My Lord,&mdash;I have the honour to acquaint your lordship that
intelligence has been received that two French Frigates, a Corvette,
and a lugger, appeared off the East of Pembrokeshire, on
the 22nd instant, and, on the evening of that day, disembarked
some troops (reported by deserters to be about 1,200 men, but
without any field pieces). Every exertion had been made by the
Lord Lieutenant, and gentlemen of that county, and its neighbourhood,
for taking the proper steps on this occasion; and the greatest
zeal and loyalty has been shewn by all ranks of people. Immediately,
on an account having been received at Plymouth, of
this force having appeared in the Bristol Channel, frigates were
despatched from Plymouth in quest of them.</p>

<p class="sigright">
<span class="l2">I have the honour to be, &amp;c.</span><br />
<span class="smcap">Portland</span>.
</p></blockquote>

<p>In the âTimesâ of March 13, 1797, is the <span class="locked">following:&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p class="center"><i>Commodore</i> <span class="smcap">Nelsonâs</span> <i>Receipt to make an Olla-Podrida.</i></p>

<p>Take a Spanish first-rate, and an 80 gun ship and after well
<i>battering</i> and <i>basting</i> them for an hour, keep throwing in your
<i>force balls</i>, and be sure to let them be <i>well seasoned</i>. Your <i>fire</i><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52">52</a></span>
must never <i>slacken</i> for a single moment, but must be kept up as
<i>brisk</i> as possible during the whole time. So soon as you perceive
your Spaniards to be well <i>stewed</i> and <i>blended</i> together you must
then throw your own ship on board of the two-decker. Lash
your sprit-sail-yard to her mizen-mast: then jump into her quarter
gallery, sword in hand, and let the rest of your boarders follow as
they can. The moment you appear on the 80 gun shipâs quarter
deck, the Spaniards will all throw down their arms and fly: you
will then have only to take a hop, step and a jump, from your
<i>stepping stone</i>, and you will find yourself in the middle of the
first-rateâs quarter-deck with all the Spaniards at your feet. Your
Olla Podrida may now be considered as completely <i>dished</i> and fit
to be set before his <span class="smcap">Majesty</span>.&mdash;<i>Nelsonâs New Art of Cookery.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>Negotiations for peace with France had been going on
during the year, and Lord Malmesbury went over to Lisle
to conduct them on the part of the English, but they came
to nothing. The French, however, in order to keep us in
anxiety, massed large quantities of troops on their coast,
which the Directory ordered should be called the âArmy
of England,â and they gave Bonaparte the command of it.
It was destined to come to nothing. Napoleon had made
peace with the Austrians, and was then given the above
command.</p>

<p>In 1798 the caricatures with regard to the relations between
France and England became more numerous, and in this
year the personal entity of Napoleon is confessed, and his
likeness, a somewhat rough one, but still recognisable, is
established. An early one in this year is, the âStorm
Rising, or the Republican Flotilla in danger,â Feb. 1798, by
Gillray. Fox, Sheridan, the Duke of Bedford, and Mr.
Tierney are represented as working a windlass, which is
used to pull over the Flotilla. This is represented by a huge
raft bristling with cannon; a large fort is in the centre, and
minor ones all around which bear flags inscribed âLiberty,
Atheism, Blasphemy, Invasion, Requisitions, Plunder,
Beggary, Murder, Destruction, Anarchy, and Slavery. It
is represented as coming from Brest, where the devil is seen
dancing on a guillotine, fiddling, and singing, âOver de
Vater! over de Vater to Charley!ââ Foxâs coat lies on the
ground, together with a paper, a âList of the New Republican
Ministry. Citizen Volpone (Fox) Premier.â Their
designs, however, are being defeated by Pitt, who as Eolus,
is raising a storm, and blowing against the Flotilla, the
Admirals Duncan, Curtis, Howe, Gardiner, Trollope,
Colpoys, St. Vincent, Seymour, Parker, and Onslow. A<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55">55</a></span>
somewhat similar idea was worked out in a caricature by
Isaac<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">36</a> Cruikshank, January 28, 1789.</p>

<p>In March Sir John Dalrymple drew, and Gillray etched,
a series of four caricatures. The first was called the âConsequences
of a successful French Invasion,â and it shows
the French clearing out the House of Commons, and the
members in fetters. The second engraving is, âWe explain
de Rights of Man to de Noblesse.â Paineâs doctrines are
being carried out in far more than their entirety. A
guillotine takes the place of the throne, and the French
commander orders, Ã  la Cromwell, one of his men, âHere,
take away this bauble! but if there be any gold on it take
it to my lodging.â</p>

<div id="ip_55" class="figcenter" style="width: 480px;">
  <img src="images/i_055.jpg" width="480" height="600" alt="" /></div>

<p>The next one is a slap in the face for Ireland, and is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56">56</a></span>
called, âWe fly on the wings of the wind to save the Irish
Catholics from persecution,â and French sympathy is
shown by a priest being stabbed, and the holy vessels
trampled on.</p>

<p>The fourth is âMe teach de English Republicans to
work,â and the French are represented as cruel taskmasters.
Men and women are put to work in the fields, and Republicans,
with fearful whips, keep them up to the mark of
efficiency. Others are harnessed to a plough, and are kept
well to their work by a most cruel lash.</p>

<p>Napoleon gave up all idea of invading England, and in
May the expedition to Egypt was formed.</p>

<p>Foxâs French proclivities are shown in a caricature (the
Shrine of St. Anneâs Hill,<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">37</a> May 26, 1798, Gillray) where he
is seen on his knees before an altar, on which are a cap of
liberty, and two busts of Robespierre and Buonaparte.
The reredos is composed of a guillotine, and the tables of
the ten commandments are labelled âDroit de lâhomme.
1. Right to worship whom we please. 2. Right to create
and bow down to anything we chuse to set up. 3. Right
to use in vain any name we like. 4. Right to work 9 days
in the Week and do what we please on the tenth. 5. Right
to honor both Father and Mother when we find it necessary.
6. Right to Kill. 7. Right to commit Adultery. 8. Right
to Plunder. 9. Right to bear what Witness we please.
10. Right to covet our Neighbourâs house and all that is his.â
Nichols, Tierney, Lauderdale, Bedford, Lansdowne, and
Norfolk, appear in the upper background as Cherubin.</p>

<p>To give some idea of the commotion caused by the
threat of invasion, and yet not to be wearisome on the subject,
I will only give the warlike items in the number of
the <i>True Briton</i>, from which the above verses are taken,
and which may be accepted as a fair sample. âWe understand
that the Duke of Bedford has received an answer
from his Royal Highness the Commander in Chief to his
offer of service, that it would be highly acceptable to the
Government if he would exert his influence in Devonshire
for the defence of the Coast.â âHis Grace the Duke of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58">58</a></span>
Grafton has not only offered to furnish his waggons and
horses to Government, in case of emergency, but has also
expressed his desire to encourage all his neighbours and
tenants to assist with their persons and teams as far as
may be in their power.â âLast week there was a respectable
Meeting of the Inhabitants of Stowmarket, at which
it was unanimously agreed to form a Volunteer Corps of
Infantry for the defence of that Town and Hundred.â âIn
the county of Bedford, Lord Ongley, Mr. Trevor, and Mr.
Whitbread, raise, each of them, a troop of Yeomanry. The
town of Bedford raises a troop of Volunteer Cavalry.â âA
Meeting was held at Newmarket on Sunday last, after
Divine Service, for aiding Government in case of Invasion,
pursuant to the Regulations of Mr. Dundasâs Defence Bill;
when the Inhabitants all came forward in a very laudable
manner for that purpose, and most of the labourers offered
their services as pioneers, or in any other capacity that
may be deemed necessary.â âThe farmers of the Parish of
Tarvin, in Cheshire, have set a noble example to their
brethren throughout the Kingdom, in having entered into
an agreement that they will, at a momentâs notice, in case
of actual invasion, or imminent danger thereof, furnish
their respective teams, with able horses and drivers, for the
service of Government, free from any payment or gratuity
whatever; and the number of each which they bind themselves
to furnish, are 39 waggons, 68 carts, 347 horses, and
an adequate number of drivers.â</p>

<p>This is the voluntary, patriotic side of the question;
take next dayâs paper, and we see, âThere was a sharp
press from the ships in Yarmouth Roads on Tuesday evening,
by which means some good Seamen were procured.â</p>

<p>There is a vast amount of humour in âAnticipation,
Ways and Means, or Buonaparte really takenâ (I. Cruikshank,
August 13, 1798). This represents a booth at a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59">59</a></span>
country fair, where a Pierrot in tricolour costume (Fox), is
showing to a lot of yokels a highly imaginative show
canvas of Napoleon, with huge mouth and teeth, goggle
eyes, two daggers, and immense boots and spurs. âTo be
seen here alive, the noted Bony Parte, from Egypt. <span class="xlarge bold hand">â</span>&nbsp;An
undoubted likeness.â With tears streaming down his
cheeks, he assures his audience that âhe is certainly taken.
I never was so pleased at any event in the whole course of
my life.â</p>

<p>Pitt, who, suffering from gout, sits down and acts as
trumpeter to the show, addresses the people thus: âBelieve
me, I do not mean to deceive you this time: he is really
<i>taken</i>, and in this Booth at this present moment. Out
with your pence good people&mdash;donât be so shy&mdash;Tumble
up Mr. Bull&mdash;the only booth in the fair! donât be alarmâd&mdash;he
is perfectly tame I assure you.â</p>

<p>The expedition to Egypt may be said to be the starting-point
from which came the numerous caricatures of
Napoleon. Before this, he had been known only by his
victorious career in Italy, and had never come into active
hostility with England; but now that we were to measure
our strength with the Chief of the âArmy of England,â he
became an important person, and, consequently, the caricaturists,
ever feeling the public pulse, took him up, and
found it to their benefit.</p>

<p>The occupation of Egypt by the French, if successful,
would have led to their attacking our empire in India, and
this was Napoleonâs design. Why the flotilla was ever
allowed to go on its way unmolested, is hard to conceive;
but it was so, and on May, 19, 1798, sailed out of Toulon
13 sail of the line, 7 frigates, 62 gunboats, and 400
transport vessels, having 20,000 troops and large quantities
of military stores on board. There were also 121
men learned in different branches of science, who accompanied<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60">60</a></span>
the expedition, and the whole was under the
supreme command of Napoleon.</p>

<p>On June 11 they reached Malta, which surrendered
without resistance, and then went on their way. Nelson
followed them, and got to Malta, where he arrived on the
22nd, only to find that the French had left some days
before, on which he sailed for Alexandria, getting there on
June 28, but found no news of the French fleet; so,
instead of waiting for them, he steered northward for
Caramania, and then went to Sicily; whence, after refitting,
he sailed again for Alexandria.</p>

<p>In the meantime the French, of course, took advantage
of his (to them) lucky absence; and, on July 2, they disembarked
the army, and took possession of Alexandria,
but not without some loss on the side of the French; and
the bodies of the soldiers thus slain were by Napoleonâs
orders buried at the foot of Pompeyâs Pillar, and their
names were to be engraved on the Column.</p>

<p>And now, as it will be a frequent article of impeachment
against Napoleon in this book, let us examine into
the truth of his turning Mahometan, and see, first, what
foundation it had in fact from the mouths of his own
countrymen. De Bourrienne gives a proclamation made by
Napoleon to his soldiers before their arrival in Egypt,
from which I extract only those sentences bearing on this
<span class="locked">subject:&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>
<p class="sigright">
<span class="l1">Head Quarters, on board the âOrient.â</span><br />
The 4th Messidor, Year VI. (June 22, 1798.)
</p>

<p>Soldiers,&mdash;The people amongst whom you are going to live,
are Mahometans. The first article of their faith is this: âThere
is no God but God, and Mahomet is his Prophet.â Do not contradict
this. Behave to them as you have behaved to the Jews&mdash;to
the Italians. Pay respect to their muftis, and their imams, as
you did to the rabbis and the bishops. Extend to the ceremonies
prescribed by the Alcoran, and to the Mosques, the same toleration<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61">61</a></span>
which you showed to the synagogues, to the religion of Moses,
and of Jesus Christ. The Roman legions protected all religions.</p></blockquote>

<p>And again, the same author says: âOn arriving at
Alexandria, the General in Chief issued a proclamation to
the people of Egypt, which, besides adverting to the
insults and extortions experienced by French merchants
from the Beys, contained the following <span class="locked">passages:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>ââPeople of Egypt,&mdash;You will be told that I am come
to destroy your religion&mdash;do not believe it. Be assured
that I come to restore your rights, to punish the usurpers,
and that I respect more than the Mamelukes, God, his
prophet, and the Alcoran. Tell them that all men are
equal in the eye of God; wisdom, talents, and virtue make
the only difference.</p>

<p>ââCadis, Sheiks, Imans, Scorbajis, tell the people that
we are the friends of the true Mussulmans. Have we not
destroyed the Pope, who says that war ought to be made
upon Mussulmans? Have we not destroyed the Knights
of Malta, because those bigots believed that God required
them to raise their swords against the Mussulmans?ââ</p>

<p>And again (still quoting from the same authority), in a
proclamation to the people of Cairo, dated from Ghizeh,
4th Thermidor, year VI. (July 22, 1798): âFear nothing for
your families, your houses, or your property; and least of
all, for the religion of the prophet, which I respect
(<i>jâaime</i>).â</p>

<p>In another proclamation to the inhabitants of Cairo,
according to âBuonapartiana,â he is made to say: âMake
known to the people that since the world has been a world, it
was written, that having destroyed the <i>enemies of Islamism</i>,
<i>the Cross</i> should be thrown down; I have come from the
extreme confines of the West, to fulfil the task which has
been imposed upon me. Shew your people that in the
book of the Koran, in more than twenty passages, that what<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62">62</a></span>
has happened has been predicted, and that what will
happen is equally explained.â</p>

<p>In a French History<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">39</a> he is described as conversing with
the Muftis and Imams in the Pyramid of Cheops. At
p. 171 he says, âHonour to Allah!â at p. 172, âGlory to
Allah! There is no other God but God, Mahomet is his
prophet, and I am one of his friends;â and at p. 173,
âMufti, I thank you, the divine Koran is the joy of my soul,
and the occupation of my eyes. I love the prophet; and I
am reckoning, before long, to see and honour his tomb in
the Holy City.â</p>

<p class="smaller">Bonaparte turning Turk at Cairo for Interest, after swearing on
the Sacrement to support y<sup>e</sup> Catholic Faith.</p></div></div>

<p>It is not worth while to multiply instances. His policy
led him to conciliate the people, and, probably, his utterances
were rather more in accordance with their religious
ideas than would have been conformable in the mouth of
a zealous Christian. But to the English caricaturist and
satirist they were <i>bonnes bouches</i>, and they twisted and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63">63</a></span>
distorted them to suit their purposes. It became almost
an article of belief with the average Englishman, that
Napoleon had embraced the Mahometan religion. Were
there not his own proclamations to prove it? Gillray even
depicted him as undergoing a ceremony of reception into
the Mahometan religion, surrounded as he is by Muftis, one
of whom puts a turban on his head, another sonorously
reads from the Koran, whilst a third brandishes a fearful
knife for circumcision.</p>

<p>After the entry into Alexandria, Napoleon, by several
proclamations, imposed the strictest discipline upon his
soldiers; and, although it is possible some irregularities
may have occurred on the part of the troops, such scenes
as were depicted by Cruikshank and Combe, one with his

cavalry, recruited from slaves bought in Georgia, the
Caucasus, and even in Europe. The pretence against them
was injustice and oppression against French merchants;
but the <i>real</i> reason for it is in the proclamation dated on
board the âOrient,â of 4th Messidor, year VI.: âSoldiers, you
are about to undertake a conquest, the effects of which on
civilisation and commerce are incalculable. <i>The blow you
are about to give to England, will be the best aimed, and the

  <div class="caption">MASSACRE IN EGYPT.</div></div>

<p>With what intensity Bonaparte hated England! For
example, take this little extract from Madame Junot,<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">41</a> to
whose brother Napoleon was speaking: ââEngland!â he
then rejoined. âSo you think in Paris that we are going
to attack it at last? The Parisians are not mistaken; it
is indeed to humble that saucy nation that we are arming.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66">66</a></span>
England! If my voice has any influence, never shall England
have an hourâs truce. Yes, yes, war with England for
ever, until its utter destruction.ââ</p>

<p>Alexandria was taken and garrisoned; but this was
only the commencement of the campaign. Cairo must be
reached speedily, and at all hazards. Then came that terrible
march across the desert, from the 7th to the 10th of July&mdash;with
generals all but mutinous, with Lannes and Murat
dashing their cocked hats on the sands and trampling upon
them in sight of the soldiers; the burning sun, the scarcity
of water, harassed by enemies, human and insect&mdash;what
joy could exceed theirs when they reached the Nile at
RahmaniÃ©! That wild rush into the water, without even
thinking of the depth, and then the welcome shade and the
juicy melons in such abundance; it must have been a
glimpse of heaven to those poor half-maddened, half-starved
soldiers.</p>

<p>After a brief rest they pushed on towards Cairo. On
July 19 they sighted the pyramids; on the 21st they
had to encounter Mourad Bey, who had a force of 8,000
Mamelukes, forty pieces of cannon, and 20,000 infantry
Then was it that, pointing to those grand historical
monuments, Napoleon addressed his soldiers with the ever-memorable
and oft-quoted speech: âSoldiers! From the
summit of those pyramids forty centuries look down upon
you.â</p>

<p>We know the issue of that battle&mdash;how, out of 8,000
Mamelukes that proudly sat their steeds that morning,
6,000 bit the dust ere night. The French that day drank
deep of blood, for 10,000 of the Egyptian troops lay dead
on the field; they took 1,000 prisoners, and all their artillery
and baggage. They could make no further stand, and
the way to Cairo was open. A small force under Dupuy
took possession of the city, which they found almost<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67">67</a></span>
deserted, and on July 24, the <i>Sultan Kebir</i>, or <i>King of Fire</i>,
as the natives had christened Napoleon, made his formal
entry into Cairo. A brief rest to tranquillise the place and
restore confidence to its returning inhabitants, and then,
leaving Desaix in charge of the city, Napoleon went in
pursuit of Ibrahim Bey, and drove him into Syria.</p>

<p>But what news was to welcome the conqueror back to
Cairo? Sad indeed was the tale he heard&mdash;nought less
than the destruction and capture of his whole fleet, save
two ships, which effected their escape. Nelson had made
up for lost time, and on August 1 he fought the âBattle of
the Nile,â when âLâOrientâ was blown up, and young Casabianca,
the son of the captain of the ship, with it. We all
know the poem by Mrs. Hemans commencing, âThe boy
stood on the burning deck.â</p>

<p>De Bourrienne does not disguise the effect this disaster
had upon Napoleon. He says: âThe catastrophe of Aboukir
came like a thunderbolt upon the General-in-Chief. In
spite of all his energy and fortitude, he was deeply distressed
by the disasters which now assailed him. To the
painful feelings excited by the complaints and dejection of
his companion-in-arms, was now added the irreparable misfortune
of the burning our fleet. He measured the fatal
consequences of this event at a single glance. We were
now cut off from all communication with France, and all
hope of returning thither, except by a degrading capitulation
with an implacable and hated enemy. Bonaparte had
lost all chance of preserving his conquest, and to him this
was indeed a bitter reflection.â</p>

<p>But with what different feelings was the news received
in England! There was no steam, no electricity, then;
men did not receive their news red-hot as we do now, but
had to wait for it, more or less calmly, according to their
temperament. Let us take this battle of the Nile as an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68">68</a></span>
example. It was fought on August 1. On September 1
the âTrue Britonâ (from which the following extracts are
taken) gives its readers an âExtract from a letter from
Strasbourg, of the 20th August,â in which a circumstantial
account of the total destruction and capture of the French
fleet by that of England is given, together with a veracious
statement that âthe latter lost their Admiral Nelson, who,
nevertheless, two hours before he died of his wounds,
received General Buonaparte on board his ship (the âCullodenâ)
<i>Prisoner, with all his General Staff</i>.â This correspondentâs
veracity is only equalled by his impartiality.</p>

<p>On September 17 we hear of the sailing of the English
fleet from Syracuse in quest of her enemy. On September
21 we have a quotation from the âRedacteurâ of September
14: âThe same Letters inform us, that the Squadron of
Admiral Brueys had anchored on the coast of <i>Bignieres</i>,
and was preparing to return to France, when it was
attacked by the English Squadron, which was superior to
ours, both in the number and the size of the vessels; that
on both sides the action was maintained with a degree of
obstinacy, of which History affords no example; that
during the action the Vessel of the French Admiral was
burnt; that two or three French Ships sunk; and that some
others, both French and English, ran aground after having
lost all their Masts; and that, finally, some other French
ships, quite disabled, remained on the spot where the Battle
was fought.â</p>

<p>It was not till October 2 that a glimmer of the truth, through
rather a roundabout channel, appeared in the papers; and
later on that day appeared a âLondon Gazette extraordinary,â
with Nelsonâs despatches, which were very brief.
Who can wonder at the excessive national rejoicing?
People were drunk with joy. Take a few paragraphs from
the âTimesâ of October 3:&mdash;</p>

<p>â<span class="smcap">Drury Lane.</span>&mdash;After the play, the news of Admiral
Nelsonâs glorious victory produced a burst of patriotic exultation
that has been rarely witnessed in a theatre. âRule

and Mrs. Bland, came forward and sung it, accompanied by
numbers of the audience. It was called for, and sung, a
second time. The acclamations were the loudest and most
fervent we have ever witnessed.</p>

was immediately silenced by the appropriate observation of
another at some distance from him, âWhy, damn it, they
have&mdash;have not they?ââ</p>

<p>âAn affray happened last night opposite to the Admiralty,
where the crowd was very great. The mob, as usual,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71">71</a></span>
insisted on every person of genteel appearance pulling off
their hats; six Officers passing along, were ordered to pay
the same compliment to the mobility, and, refusing to do so,
the populace attempted to force their hats off. The Officers
drew their swords, and it was said that some persons were
wounded.â</p>

<p>The next dayâs âTimesâ (October 4) says: âTo shew the
zeal for Illumination in honour of our late splendid Victory,
a chaise last night passed through the town, in which were
three Ladies, with large cockades in their head dresses.
The inside of the chaise was lighted up; a postillion was on
each horse with flambeaux in their hands, besides two outriders,
also carrying flambeaux.â</p>

<p>âIt was remarked by a loyal Hibernian, on the official
news of Admiral Nelsonâs victory, that nothing on <i>earth</i>
could resist us by <i>sea</i>.â</p>

<p>The mob after a day or two became so uproarious that
the magistrates were compelled to order the cessation of
the illuminations.</p>

<p>On October 3 the Court of Common Council met, two
hundred strong, when the Lord Mayor read the subjoined
letter from <span class="locked">Nelson&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>
<p class="sigright">

who survived after the battle of the 1st, off the Nile, and request
that the City of London will honour me with the acceptance of it,
as a remembrance that Britannia still rules the waves; which that
she may for ever do, is the fervent prayer of</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72">72</a></span>
Naturally, this gratifying memorial of this splendid
victory was welcomed with enthusiasm, and orders were
given to provide a suitable case, with inscription, for it; and
the Council voted Nelson a sword, value 200 guineas; also
the freedom of the City in a gold box, value 100 guineas, to
Captain Berry, who was captain of the admiralâs flagship,
the âVanguard;â and the thanks of the court to every one
concerned.</p>

<p>The caricaturists soon pounced upon the subject, and the
way in which the news of the victory was taken by different
statesmen is very amusingly shown. (Gillray, October 3,
1798.) Burdett, who is always represented with his crop of
hair combed over his eyes, is reading the âExtraordinary
Gazette,â and, in astonishment, exclaims, âSure I cannot
see clear?â Jekyll is telling Lord Lansdowne how nine
French ships of war were captured and two burnt; but his
lordship claps his hands to his ears, and calls out, âI canât
hear, I canât hear.â The Duke of Bedford will not believe
it, and is tearing up the notification of âthe complete
destruction of Buonaparteâs Fleet,â exclaiming, âItâs all a
damnâd Lye;â whilst poor Erskine, with Republican briefs
before him, drops the paper which tells him of the capture
of Bonaparteâs despatches, and, with a smelling-bottle to
his nose, plaintively calls out, âI shall faint, I, I, I.â The
poor Duke of Norfolk, whose many empty bottles of port
testify to his inebriate condition, is very ill, and gives his
opinion that âNelson and the British Fleetâ is âa sickening
toast.â Tierney is in despair, and with the âEnd of the
Irish Rebellionâ in his pocket, and on his knees a paper,
âEnd of the French Navy. Britannia rules the Waves,â
calls out, with upturned eyes, âAh! our hopes are all lost.â</p>

<p>Moodily, with his head resting on his hands, sits
Sheridan, with a âList of the Republican Ships taken and
destroyedâ before him, and his thoughts are of prudence,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73">73</a></span>
âI must lock up my Jaw.â Black-visaged Fox, wearing a
Cap of Liberty, has kicked over the stool that hitherto has
supported him, and mournfully bidding âFarewell to the
Whig Club,â says, âand I&mdash;&mdash; end with Ãclat.â</p>

<p>This victory of the Nile is very graphically depicted
(Gillray, October 6, 1798) in the âExtirpation of the Plagues
of Egypt;&mdash;Destruction of Revolutionary Crocodiles;&mdash;or&mdash;The
British Hero cleansing y<sup>e</sup> Mouth of y<sup>e</sup> Nile.â Here
Nelson has half-a-dozen crocodiles (typical of captured
French ships) hooked and in his power, whilst, with a stout
cudgel of âBritish Oak,â he is spreading deadly blows and
consternation into a quantity of tricoloured crocodiles.
The blowing up of the âOrientâ is shown by one crocodile
which is thus being destroyed.</p>

<p>Another caricature (October 7, 1798) of the victory of
the Nile is âThe Gallant Nellson bringing home two uncommon
fierce French Crocodiles from the Nile as a present to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74">74</a></span>
the King.â The one-armed hero is leading by a chain Fox
and Sheridan, who have their jaws muzzled by rings, and
Foxâs mouth is also secured by a padlock, âa mouthpiece
for hypocrites.â They are both weeping copiously, after
the fabled manner of crocodiles. Nelson is saying, âCome
along you Hypocritical dogs, I dare say your Damâd sorry
now for what youâve done. No, no, I shall bring you to
my <span class="smcap">Master</span>;â whilst John Bull, habited as a countryman,
exclaims, âAye, aye, what! Horatio has got âem at <i>last</i>.
Why, these be the Old Cock Deviles. I thought as how he

of October 3.</p>

<p>A very curious caricature is (Ansell, October 24, 1798)
Bonaparte in Egypt, âA terrible Turk preparing a Mummy
for a <i>present</i> to the Grand Nation.â A Turk, terrible indeed,
has Napoleon by the throat, and, with sword in hand, is
going to despatch him, saying, âAs for you, you Dog of
no Religion, Iâll sacrifice you at the tomb of the Prophet,
whose name you have prophaned for the purposes of
Murder, Rapine, and Plunder.â</p>

<p>Napoleon, whose defenceless state is typified by his
swordless scabbard being broken, is endeavouring to mollify
the wrath of the Turk. âNow, mild and gentle Sir,
donât be so rough: do you think I would cut your throat,
ravish your wives, or plunder your house? No, by
Mahomet I would not. SacrÃ¨ Dieu, I would not. Ah,
Diable, youâll choak me.â</p>

<p>Fox, Erskine, Sheridan, and the Duke of Norfolk are
kneeling down, begging for Napoleonâs life, whilst a Turk,
who exclaims, âYou agree together so well, I think Iâll fix you
together for life,â has a bowstring ready to strangle all four.
Pleads Fox, âPray donât hurt our dear friend, he would
not hurt Man, Woman, or Child. He canât bear the sight
of blood; as for plunder or deception, he is the determined<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75">75</a></span>

<p>âJohn Bull taking a luncheonâ (Gillray, October 24,
1798) is an extremely graphic caricature, and introduces
us to the popular idea of John Bull, who, certainly, is never
represented in this period with any of the refinement that
Leech, Doyle, Tenniel, or any of our modern caricaturists
depict him; tastes and habits were coarser then than now,
and John Bull was always shown in the rough. The
second portion of the title of the picture helps us to realise
the popular fancy, âor&mdash;British Cooks cramming old <i>Grumble
Gizzard</i> with Bonne ChÃ©re.â All his admirals and captains
are bringing him food. Nelson presents him with a
<i>Fricasee Ã  la Nelson</i>, a huge dish of French ships; others are
bearing dishes, such as <i>Desert Ã  la Warren</i>, <i>Fricando Ã  la
Howe</i>, <i>Ã  la Gardner</i>, <i>Ã  la Bridport</i>, <i>Ã  la Vincent</i>, <i>Dutch
Cheese Ã  la Duncan</i>.</p>

<p>John Bull is seated, devouring these viands, which are
to be washed down with mighty draughts of <i>True British
Stout</i>, exclaiming, âWhat! more Frigasees? why you sons oâ<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76">76</a></span>
b&mdash;&mdash;s, you, where do you think I shall find room to stow
all you bring in?â Fox and Sheridan are seen through
an open window, running away, calling out, âOh curse his
Guts, heâll take a chop at us next.â</p>

<p>There is another one with similar <i>motif</i> by Ansell,
November 1, 1798.</p>

<p>The âdestruction of the French Collossusâ (Gillray,
November 1, 1798) is a painful picture. The huge creation
strides from Egypt to France; its head being a skull, with
vipers crawling in and out&mdash;its hands and feet being imbrued
in blood; it clutches the guillotine, and tramples the Bible,
Crucifix, and scales of Justice under foot. Round its neck
is the bleeding head of Louis XVI. Britannia (typified
by a shield of the national flag) hurls a thunderbolt, and
shatters the huge statue into pieces.</p>

<p>I have omitted an episode which, to be chronologically
correct, should have been introduced earlier; and here,
as usual, we find a French authority for what might seem
an English slander: Ãmile de la BÃ©doliÃ©re, in his âTableau

<p>âOn the 30th Vendemaire, year VII. (October 21, 1798),
a multitude ran through the streets, and massacred all the
French they met. Bonaparte repaired to the scene, and
took measures to cut the communications between the
different quarters of the city, which were in the hands of
the insurgents. Fifteen thousand of them took refuge in
the great mosque, and refused to surrender. A hail of
bombs, shells, and bullets, threatened to engulph them
under the dÃ©bris of their last asylum. Soon they uttered
lamentable cries, implored the mercy of the general-in-chief,
and surrendered at discretion.â</p>

<p>Cruikshank, of course, grossly exaggerates the fact,

<p>In November (12th) of this year, Rowlandson produced
a plate called âHigh fun for John Bull, or the Republicans

great glee at having captured so many ships, whilst the
French are hard at work making fresh ones, which they
are baking by batches in a <i>Dutch Oven</i> (an allusion to
their being built in Holland). A Frenchman, with a large

<p>John Bull, who holds a whip in his hand, says, âWhat!
you could not find that out before, you stupid Dupes; but
since you began the fun, you shall keep on. So work
away, Damn ye, else Jack Tar will soon be idle.â A sailor
carrying a trayful of ships on his head, calls out, âPush
on, keep moving, Iâll soon come for another cargo. Old
England for ever. Huzza!â</p>

<p>âFighting for the Dunghill&mdash;or&mdash;Jack Tar settling
Buonaparte,â is by Gillray, November 20, 1798. Napoleon
is terribly punished, his body being a mass of bruises
and wounds, the worst being a large one in the breast, and
labelled <i>Nelson</i>. Blood is streaming from his nose, and
Jack is driving him out of the world altogether, having his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80">80</a></span>
foot upon Malta, whilst Napoleon is insecure in Turkey.
This engraving is an extremely typical one of the burly,

<p>Napoleon is depicted by Gillray (December 8, 1798)
as being in a fearful rage&mdash;and an extremely diverting
sketch it is. It is called âBuonaparte hearing of Nelsonâs
Victory, swears by his sword to extirpate the English from
off the Earth. See Buonaparteâs Speech to the French
Army at Cairo, published by authority of the Directory in
Volneyâs Letters.â His melodramatic pose, and costume,
are superb. A huge cocked hat and feathers, the hat
adorned with a crescent (to show his supposed Mahometan
proclivities), as well as a tricoloured cockade, surmounts his
head, which bears a most ferocious expression, somewhat
heightened by the formidable pigtail which he wears. A
huge green necktie is round his neck, and he wears a tricoloured
scarf, in which are stuck a pistol and dagger; boots,
with huge spurs, add to the dignity of the costume. He
is waving his bloody sword, and stamps upon a paper,
âNelsonâs Victory over the Fleet of the Republic,â while he
shouts out: âWhat? our Fleet captured and destroyed by
the slaves of Britain? by my sword and by holy Mahomet
I swear eternal Vengeance! yes, when I have subjected
Egypt, subdued the Arabs, the Druses, and the Maronites;
become master of Syria; turnâd the great river Euphrates,
and sailed upon it through the sandy deserts; compelled
to my assistance the Bedouins, Turcomans, Kurds, Armenians,
and Persians; formed a million of cavalry, and
passâd them upon rafts, six or seven hundred miles over the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81">81</a></span>
Bosphorus, I shall enter Constantinople. Now I enter the
Theatre of Europe, I establish the republic of Greece, I

y<sup>e</sup> Imperial Eagle, I drive the ferocious English from the
Archipelago, I hunt them from the Mediterranean, and
blot them out from the catalogue of Nations. Then shall
the conquerâd Earth sue for Peace, and an Obelisk be erected
at Constantinople, inscribed âTo Buonaparte, conqueror
of the World, and extirpator of the <span class="smcap">English Nation</span>.ââ</p>

<p>This brings the year 1798 to a close of the prosperity,
or otherwise, of which we may judge by the price of the
quartern loaf, which averaged 8Â½<i>d.</i> for the year, and
by the three per cent. Consols., which were 49-5/8 in
January, and 52-5/8 in December; but in this, as in other
stocks, there was much fluctuation: for instance, in
September Consols. were 49-7/8; then came the news of the
victory of the Nile, and up they went to 56Â½, only, however,
to fall to 50Â½. But they rose again in November to
57-5/8, fell again to 52-1/8, and rose in December to 56.</p>

<p>The new year opens with a somewhat curious print by
I. Cruikshank, January 1, 1799, of the âGhost of Buonaparte
appearing to the Directory.â The latter are in fearful
dismay at the apparition, which, attired in the airiest of
costume, shakes his notched sword at them, saying, âRegicides,
Parricides, Matricides, and Patricides, this is the
effect of your insatiable thirst for Conquest; this is your
reward for my glorious Achievements in Italy, Germany,
&amp;c.&mdash;to die by the hand of an Assassin, a d&mdash;d Mussulman:
and all my Brave Legions Destroyed by Water melons and
the Arabs. Go, Murderers in cold blood, may your conscious
guilt ever prey upon your vitals, and may the name of
<i>Nelson</i> ever haunt you, sleeping and wakingâ! What is
meant by his dying âby the hand of an Assassin,â I do not
know; but probably some rumour was afloat to that effect, as
Barre observes: âWhilst Buonaparte and his army were thus
cut off from Europe, the most absurd reports were spread
(no doubt by the partisans of the artful Corsican) representing
him as a victim of the Directory, who had thought
proper to remove so great, famous, and fortunate a general.</p>

<p>âThey pretended that the Directory, unable to repay
the signal services of Buonaparte, and, fearing, at the same
time, his popularity, had contrived, with Talleyrand, to flatter<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83">83</a></span>
the ambitious vanity of that young conqueror with an
expedition, which would raise his fame above the glory
acquired by Alexander, or CÃ¦sar. They added, that, as
Buonaparte was sure of being director at the next election,
the Directory had resolved to put him out of the way, by
sacrificing him and his army; having even directed that
the fleet should be exposed to certain destruction, in order
that no possibility could exist of his return.â</p>

<p>Meanwhile Napoleon was taking things pretty easily in
Egypt, enjoying himself after his manner. It is a marvel
that none of the English caricaturists ever depicted this
portion of his life. True, Gillray, as we have seen, drew
him in Turkish costume; but he never wore it but once,
and then but for a very short time. But why did they
spare him in his <i>amour</i> with Madame FourÃ©s (Pauline,
or <i>Queen of the East</i>, as the army christened her)? De
Bourrienne makes no secret of it. He says: âAbout the
middle of September in this year (1798), Buonaparte<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84">84</a></span>
ordered to be brought to the house of Elfy Bey, half a
dozen Asiatic women, whose beauty he had heard highly
extolled. However, their ungraceful obesity displeased
him, and they were immediately dismissed. A few days
after, he fell violently in love with Madame FourÃ©s,<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">44</a> the
wife of a lieutenant of Infantry. She was very pretty, and
her charms were enhanced by the rarity of seeing a woman,
in Egypt, who was calculated to please the eye of a European.
Bonaparte engaged, for her, a house adjoining the
palace of Elfy Bey, which he occupied. He frequently
ordered dinner to be prepared there, and I used to go there
with him at seven oâclock, and leave him at nine.</p>

<p>âThis connection soon became the general subject of
gossip at head-quarters. Through a feeling of delicacy to
M. FourÃ©s, the General in Chief gave him a mission to the
Directory. He embarked at Alexandria, and the ship was
captured by the English, who, being informed of the Cause
of his mission, were malicious enough to send him back to
Egypt, instead of keeping him prisoner.â</p>

<p>But he was not one to waste much time in dalliance.
Turkey was not at all satisfied with the occupation of
Egypt, and two armies were assembled, one in Syria, and
one at Rhodes; the former of which had already pushed
forward into Egyptian territory as far as El-Arisch, and
also a train of artillery had been placed at Jaffa (the ancient
Joppa). The commander of this <i>corps dâarmÃ©e</i> (Achmet
Pacha) had earned the unenviable title of <i>Djezzar</i>, or <i>the
Butcher</i>. Napoleon, very early in the year 1799, marched
against him, his busy brain having schemed the plan of
crushing these Turkish troops, a demonstration against
Constantinople itself, a forced peace with the Porte, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85">85</a></span>
then hey! for India. To pave the way for this latter he
actually wrote to Tippoo Sahib, saying he was coming to
deliver him from the English yoke, and requesting his
answer, which he might possibly have received, had not
Tippoo been killed on May 4 of that year.</p>

<p>Napoleon, by way of conciliating the Egyptians, assisted
at the celebration of âRamadan,â with great pomp, which,
naturally, would afford his detractors another opportunity
for outcry at his Mahometan proclivities. As soon as it
was over, he set out against Achmet Pacha, and, on February
17, El-Arisch capitulated, and the army marched to
Gaza. How the vanguard lost their way, and their terrible
sufferings in the desert, it boots not to tell. Gaza was taken,
its stores were confiscated, and then Jaffa was their bourne,
which was reached, and invested, on March 4.</p>

<p>Before reading the sad page of history which Jaffa gives
us, let us glance at one or two caricatures which appeared
in England about this time. Napoleon had taken with
him, in his expedition to Egypt, Denon and divers other
learned men to investigate the archÃ¦ology of the country,
&amp;c., and most valuable were the services of âthe Institute,â
as this body of <i>savants</i> was called. They furnished some
fun to the army, and the cry, when any danger threatened,
of âthe Asses and the <i>Savants</i> to the centre,â was naturally
productive of mirth; the army also christening the asses
â<i>Demi-savants</i>.â</p>

<p>Gillray makes great fun of the expedition to Egypt, and
satirises the French soldiers unmercifully; nor do the poor
<i>savants</i> who accompanied the army fare any better. A
good example is the âSiege de la Colonne de PompÃ©e, or
Science in the Pillory,â published March 6, 1799. At the
foot of the picture is: âIt appears by an intercepted letter
from General Kleber, dated Alexandria, 5 brumaire, 7th
year of the Republic, that when the garrison was obliged to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86">86</a></span>
retire into the New Town, at the approach of the Turkish
Army, under the Pacha of Rhodes, a party of the <i>sÃ§avans</i>,
who had ascended Pompeyâs Pillar for scientific purposes,
was cut off by a Band of Bedouin Arabs, who, having made
a large Pile of Straw, and dry Reeds, at the foot of the
Pillar, set fire to it, and rendered unavailing the gallant
defence of the learned Garrison, of whose Catastrophe the
above design is intended to convey an idea.</p>

<div class="poem-container">

<p>The <i>savants</i> are, indeed, in a parlous state, on the broad
summit of the pillar, exposed to fire from below, and the
guns and pistols of the Arabs; they defend themselves
as well as possible by hurling their globes, and scientific
instruments, at their assailants, who are exceedingly astonished
at them. A balloon, La Diligence dâAbyssinie,
is fired at, and struck, the aeronauts, one of whom has a
parachute, being precipitated to the ground.</p>

<p>âThe Institute,â which was modelled on that of Paris, also
gave scope to Gillrayâs facile pencil, and he published a series
of half a dozen plates, in the first one of which it was most
amusingly caricatured. It was published on March 12,
1799, and called, âLâInsurrection de lâInstitut Amphibie&mdash;The
pursuit of Knowledge.â A <i>savant</i> is depicted as studying<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87">87</a></span>
a work âSur lâEducation du Crocodile,â some plates from
which have dropped out. They show how useful the crocodile
may become, by training, to tow vessels, and to ride
and drive on land. He evidently is intending to put his
theories into practice, for he has brought with him, to the
riverâs side, a saddle, a fearfully cruel bridle, and a huge
whip, when he is seized by an enormous saurian, and devoured.
Another learned man, who has been reading âLes
Droits du Crocodile,â drops it, when he finds one of these
creatures asserting its rights by seizing his coat-tails.</p>

<p>TAKING OF JAFFA, AND MASSACRE OF SOLDIERS&mdash;DE BOURRIENNEâS
ACCOUNT&mdash;NAPOLEONâS OWN VERSION.</p></blockquote>

<p>It is sad to turn from this rollicking fun to the episode of
Jaffa; but it cannot be dismissed, as it has afforded so much
employment to the detractors of Napoleon, and to the
English satirists of the time. First of all, let us give the
version of an eye-witness (De Bourrienne), friend of, and
secretary to, Napoleon. It is rather long, but no word of it
can be omitted, as it gives every argument that can be
brought forward to palliate the sickening massacre.</p>

<p>âOn the 4th of March we commenced the siege of Jaffa.
That paltry place, which, to round a sentence, was pompously
styled the ancient Joppa, held out only to the 6th of
March, when it was taken by storm, and given up to pillage.
The massacre was horrible. General Bonaparte sent his
aides de camp, Beauharnais and Croisier, to appease the
fury of the soldiers as much as possible, to observe what
was passing, and to report to him. They learnt that a
considerable part of the garrison had retired into some vast
buildings, a sort of caravanserais, which formed a large
enclosed court. Beauharnais and Croisier, who were distinguished
by wearing the aide de camp scarf on the arm,
proceeded to that place.</p>

<p>âThe Arnauts and Albanians, of whom these refugees
were almost entirely composed, cried, from the windows,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89">89</a></span>
that they were willing to surrender, upon an assurance
that they would be exempted from the massacre to which
the town was doomed; if not, they threatened to fire on
the aides de camp, and to defend themselves to the last
extremity. The two officers thought that they ought to
accede to the proposition, notwithstanding the decree of
death which had been pronounced against the whole garrison,
in consequence of the town being taken by storm.
They brought them to our camp in two divisions, one consisting
of about two thousand five hundred men, the other
of about fifteen hundred.</p>

<p>âI was walking with General Bonaparte, in front of his
tent, when he saw this multitude of men approaching, and,
before he even saw his aides de camp, he said to me in a
tone of profound sorrow, âWhat do they wish me to do with
these men? Have I food for them? ships to convey them
to Egypt or France? Why, in the Devilâs name, have
they served me thus?â After their arrival, and the
explanations which the General in Chief demanded, and
listened to with anger, Eugene and Croisier received the
most severe reprimand for their conduct.</p>

<p>âBut the deed was done. Four thousand men were
there. It was necessary to decide upon their fate. The
two aides de camp observed, that they had found themselves
alone in the midst of numerous enemies, and that he had
directed them to restrain the carnage. âYes, doubtless,â
replied the General in Chief, with great warmth, âas to
women, children, and old men&mdash;all the peaceable inhabitants;
but not with respect to armed soldiers. It was your
duty to die, rather than bring these unfortunate creatures
to me. What do you want me to do with them?â These
words were pronounced in the most angry tone.</p>

<p>âThe prisoners were then ordered to sit down, and were
placed, without any order, in front of the tents, their hands<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90">90</a></span>
tied behind their backs. A sombre fury was depicted in
their countenances. We gave them a little biscuit and bread,
squeezed out of the already scanty supply for the army.</p>

<p>âOn the first day of their arrival, a council of war was
held in the tent of the General in Chief, to determine what
course should be pursued with respect to them. The
Council deliberated a long time without coming to any
decision.</p>

<p>âOn the evening of the following day, the daily reports
of the generals of division came in. They spoke of nothing
but the insufficiency of the rations, the complaints of the
soldiers&mdash;of their murmurs and discontent at seeing their
bread given to enemies, who had been withdrawn from
their vengeance, inasmuch as a decree of death, in conformity
with the laws of war, had been passed on Jaffa.
All these reports were alarming, and especially that of
General Bon, in which no reserve was made. He spoke of
nothing less than the fear of revolt, which would be justified
by the serious nature of the case.</p>

<p>âThe Council assembled again. All the generals of
division were summoned to attend, and, for several hours
together, they discussed, under separate questions, what
measures might be adopted, with the most sincere desire
to discover and execute one which would save the lives of
these unfortunate prisoners.</p>

<p>âShould they be sent to Egypt? could it be done?</p>

<p>âTo do so, it would be necessary to send with them
a numerous escort, which would too much weaken our
little army in the enemyâs country. How, besides, could
they and the escort be supported till they reached Cairo,
having no provisions to give them on setting out, and,
their route being through a hostile territory, which we had
exhausted, which presented no fresh resources, and through
which we, perhaps, might have to return?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91">91</a></span>
âShould they be embarked?</p>

<p>âWhere were the ships? where could they be found?
All our optical instruments, directed over the sea, could
not descry a single friendly sail. Bonaparte, I affirm,
would have regarded such an event as a real favour of
fortune. It was, and I am glad to have to say it, this sole
idea, this sole hope, which made him brave, for three days,
the murmurs of his army. But in vain was help looked
for, seawards&mdash;It did not come.</p>

<p>âShould the prisoners be set at liberty?</p>

<p>âThey would then proceed to St. Jean dâAcre to reinforce
the Pacha, or else, throwing themselves into the
mountains of Naplouse, would greatly annoy our rear and
right flank, and deal out death to us, as a recompense for
the life we had given them. There could be no doubt of
this. What is a Christian dog to a Turk? It would even
have been a religious and meritorious act in the eyes of
the Prophet.</p>

<p>âCould they be incorporated, disarmed, with our soldiers
in the ranks?</p>

<p>âHere again the question of food presented itself in all
its force. Next came to be considered the danger of
having such comrades, while marching through an enemyâs
country. What might happen in the event of a battle
before St. Jean dâAcre? Could we even tell what might
occur during the march? and&mdash;finally&mdash;what must be done
with them when under the ramparts of that town, if we
should be able to take them there? The same embarrassments
with respect to the questions of provisions, and
security, would then recur with increased force.</p>

<p>âThe third day arrived without its being possible,
anxiously as it was desired, to come to any conclusion
favourable to the preservation of these unfortunate men.
The murmurs in the camp grew louder&mdash;the evil went on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92">92</a></span>
increasing&mdash;remedy appeared impossible&mdash;danger was real
and imminent.</p>

<p>âThe order for shooting the prisoners was given and
executed on the 10th of March. We did not, as has been
stated, separate the Egyptians from the other prisoners.
There were no Egyptians.</p>

<p>âMany of the unfortunate creatures composing the
smaller division, which was fired on close to the sea-coast,
at some distance from the other column, succeeded in
swimming to some reefs of rocks out of the reach of musket
shot. The soldiers rested their muskets on the sand,
and, to induce the prisoners to return, employed the
Egyptian signs of reconciliation, in use in that country.
They came back; but, as they advanced, they were killed,
and disappeared among the waves.â</p>

<p>Thus far De Bourrienne. Now let us hear what Napoleon
himself says of the matter.<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">45</a> âHe spoke about the
measures which he had caused to be taken at Jaffa.
âAfter the assault,â said he, âit was impossible to restore
any kind of discipline until night. The infuriated soldiers
rushed into the streets in search of women. You know
what kind of people the Turks are. A few of them kept
up a fire in the streets. The soldiers, who desired
nothing more, whenever a shot was discharged, cried
out that they were fired upon from certain houses,
which they immediately broke open, and violated all the
women they found.â</p>

<p>âI replied<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">46</a> that Miot ... positively asserted that he
(Napoleon) had caused between three and four thousand
Turks to be shot, some days after the capture of Jaffa.
Napoleon answered: âIt is not true that there were so<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93">93</a></span>
many. I ordered about a thousand or twelve hundred to
be shot, which was done. The reason was, that amongst
the garrison of Jaffa, a number of Turkish troops were
discovered, whom I had taken a short time before at
El-Arish, and sent to Bagdat upon their parole not to
serve again, or to be found in arms against me for a year.
I had caused them to be escorted twelve leagues on their
way to Bagdat, by a division of my army. But those
Turks, instead of proceeding to Bagdat, threw themselves
into Jaffa, defended it to the last, and cost me a number of
brave men to take it, whose lives would have been spared,
if the others had not reinforced the garrison of Jaffa.
Moreover, before I attacked the town, I sent them a flag
of truce. Immediately afterwards we saw the head of the
bearer elevated on a pole over the wall. Now, if I had
spared them again, and sent them away upon their parole,
they would directly have gone to St. Jean dâAcre, where
they would have played over again the same scene that
they had done at Jaffa. In justice to the lives of my
soldiers, as every general ought to consider himself as
their father, and them as his children, I could not allow
this.</p>

<p>ââTo leave as a guard a portion of my army, already
small and reduced in number, in consequence of the breach
of faith of those wretches, was impossible. Indeed, to have
acted otherwise than I did, would probably have caused
the destruction of my whole army. I, therefore, availing
myself of the rights of war, which authorise the putting to
death prisoners taken under such circumstances, independent
of the right given to me by having taken the city by
assault, and that of retaliation on the Turks, ordered that
the prisoners taken at El-Arish, who, in defiance of their
capitulation, had been found bearing arms against me,
should be selected out and shot. The rest, amounting to a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94">94</a></span>
considerable number, were spared. I would,â continued he,
âdo the same thing again to-morrow, and so would Wellington,
or any general commanding an army under similar
circumstances!ââ</p>

<p>Between these two partial accounts there are grave discrepancies&mdash;both
parties trying, as far as possible, to excuse
the deed; but, if De Bourrienne can be relied on, his
account of the cold-blooded massacre must be the true one,
for he says, âI confine myself to those details of this act of
dreadful necessity of which I was an eye-witness.â</p>

<p>THE MASSACRE AT JAFFA (<i>continued</i>)&mdash;ENGLISH EVIDENCE THEREON&mdash;SIEGE
OF ST. JEAN DâACRE&mdash;CAPTURE OF NAPOLEONâS BATTERING
TRAIN&mdash;FAILURE OF THE SIEGE, AND RETREAT TO JAFFA.</p></blockquote>

<p>It is a singular thing, that, even in the very meagre accounts,
of transactions in Egypt no mention of this should
have got into the English newspapers; but I have searched,
and can find none. But when, in 1803, this country was in
fear of invasion, it was brought up, and used with great
effect, in stimulating patriotism. Take, as an instance, one<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">47</a>
out of the thousands of broadsides which then flooded the
country, and we shall find that the fact, although broadly
stated, has not been exaggerated.</p>

<p>âOn the 7th that town was taken by assault. This affair
is on all hands allowed to have been bloody in the extreme;
but a tale has been brought to light, and attested by persons
of undoubted credit, so bloody, so diabolical, as to outstrip
everything which such an expression is calculated to describe.</p>

<p>âIt is asserted that three days after the capture of the
town, three thousand eight hundred prisoners were marched
to a rising ground, and there massacred by means of
musquetry, grape shot, and the bayonet. This fact was
first made known in Europe by Sir Sidney Smith, and Mr.
Morier, Secretary to Lord Elgin, now a prisoner in Paris;
its history has been minutely given by Colonel Sir Robert<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96">96</a></span>
Wilson, of Hompeschâs hussars, and its truth has been
attested by Dr. Wittman who accompanied the army of the
Grand Vizir.â</p>

<p>This Dr. Wittman was the physician to the British
Military Mission, which went with that army through
Turkey, Syria, and Egypt, and who wrote a narrative of his
travels, in which, at p. 128, he says the unfortunates were
dragged âto the sand hills, about a league distant, in the
way to Gaza, and there most inhumanly put to death. I
have seen <i>the Skeletons of those unfortunate victims</i>, which
lie scattered over the hills; a modern Golgotha, which remains
a lasting disgrace to a Nation calling itself civilised.â</p>

<p>Sir Robert Wilson says: âVollies of musquetry and grape
instantly played against them; and Buonaparte, who had
been regarding the scene through a telescope, when he saw
the smoke ascending, could not restrain his joy, but broke
out into exclamations of approval; indeed, he had just reason
to dread the refusal of his troops thus to dishonour
themselves. Kleber had remonstrated in the most strenuous
manner, and the officer of the Etat-Major, who commanded
(for the general to whom the division belonged, was absent)
even refused to execute the order without a written instruction;
but Buonaparte was too cautious, and sent Berthier to
enforce obedience.... The bones still lie in heaps, and
are shown to every traveller who arrives; nor can they be
confounded with those who perished in the assault, since
this field of butchery lies a mile from the town.â</p>

<p>Combe, of course, does not forget this incident.</p>

<p>Napoleon now turned his attention to the siege of St.
Jean dâAcre, where the garrison had the advantage of
European aid, besides which, Sir Sydney Smith cruised
about the fort, and Napoleonâs battering-train, which had
been captured, was duly pointed at the besiegers. He was,
besides, called off to help Kleber, who was in an awkward
situation at Mount Thabor, and had been fighting Achmet
Pasha, who had a considerably superior force, from six in
the morning till one in the afternoon. Not one moment
too soon did Napoleon make his appearance; but he turned
the tide of battle, and the Turks were defeated with the
loss of 5,000 or 6,000 men, and all their stores, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Back they went to St. Jean dâAcre, and did their best
at the siege; but it was not to be. Reinforcements were
thrown into the town, Napoleonâs army grew smaller, provisions
got scarcer, the plague was in their midst; so, sending
his sick and wounded to Jaffa, he raised the siege and
began to retreat on May 20.</p>

<p>OâMeara tells us Napoleonâs version of the causes which
led to this.<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">48</a> ââThe chief cause of the failure there was that
Sir Sydney Smith took all my battering-train, which was
on board of several small vessels. Had it not been for
that, I would have taken Acre in spite of him. He behaved
very bravely, and was well seconded by Phillipeaux, a
Frenchman of talent, who had studied with me as an
engineer.... The acquisition of five or six hundred seamen
as cannoniers, was a great advantage to the Turks,
whose spirits they revived, and whom they showed how to
defend the fortress.</p>

<p>ââBut he committed a great fault in making sorties,
which cost the lives of two or three hundred brave fellows,
without the possibility of success. For it was impossible he
could succeed against the number of the French who were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99">99</a></span>
before Acre. I would lay a wager, he lost half of his crew
in them. He dispersed proclamations among my troops
which certainly shook some of them, and I, in consequence,
published an order, stating that he was <i>mad</i>, and forbidding
all communication with him. Some days after, he sent, by
means of a flag of truce, a lieutenant, or a midshipman,
with a letter containing a challenge to me, to meet him at
some place he pointed out, in order to fight a duel. I
laughed at this, and sent him back an intimation that when
he brought Marlborough to fight me I would meet him.
Notwithstanding this, I like the character of the man.ââ</p>

<p>The French reached Jaffa on May 24, and found the
hospitals full of wounded and those sick of the plague.
Compelled still to retreat, it was necessary to remove the
sick; and, to encourage his soldiers in the task, and to show
them how little was the risk, Napoleon is said to have
handled several of the infected.</p>

<p>But this retreat became the subject of a dreadful accusation
against Napoleon, which must have hit him hard
at the time of his projected invasion in 1803&mdash;aye, quite as
hard as the massacre at Jaffa. It was nothing less than
that he poisoned, with opium, 500 of his sick soldiers, before
he left Jaffa. There was a solid foundation for this fearful

<p>The truth of this has never been accurately established,
but I fancy, at that time, there were very few Englishmen<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101">101</a></span>
who did not thoroughly believe it. Sir Robert Wilson
wrote: âBuonaparte finding that his hospitals at Jaffa were
crowded with sick, sent for a physician, whose name should
be inscribed in letters of gold, but which, from important
reasons, cannot be here inserted; on his arrival, he entered
into a long conversation with him respecting the danger
of contagion, concluding at last with the remark, that
something must be done to remedy the evil, and that the
destruction of the sick at present in the hospital, was the
only measure which could be adopted. The physician,
alarmed at the proposal, bold in the confidence of virtue,
and the cause of humanity, remonstrated vehemently,
respecting the cruelty, as well as the atrocity, of such a
murder; but, finding that Buonaparte persevered and
menaced, he indignantly left the tent, with this memorable
observation; âNeither my principles, nor the character of
my profession, will allow me to become a murderer; and,
General, if such qualities as you insinuate are necessary to
form a great man, I thank my God that I do not possess
them.â</p>

  <div class="caption">POISONING THE SICK AT JAFFA.</div></div>

<p>âBuonaparte was not to be diverted from his object by
moral considerations; he persevered, and found an apothecary,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102">102</a></span>
who (dreading the weight of power, but who since has
made an atonement to his mind, by unequivocally confessing
the fact) consented to become his agent, and to
administer poison to the sick. Opium, at night, was
distributed in gratifying food, the wretched, unsuspecting,
victims banqueted, and, in a few hours, five hundred and
eighty soldiers, who had suffered so much for their country,
perished thus miserably by the order of its idol....</p>

<p>âIf a doubt should still exist as to the veracity of this
statement, let the Members of the Institute at Cairo be asked
what passed in their sitting after the return of Buonaparte
from Syria; they will relate, that the same virtuous physician,
who refused to become the destroyer of those committed to
his protection, accused Buonaparte of high treason, in the
full assembly, against the honour of France, her children,
and humanity; that he entered into the full details of the
poisoning of the sick, and the massacre of the garrison,
aggravating these crimes by charging Buonaparte with
strangling, previously, at Rosetta, a number of French and
Copts, who were ill of the plague; thus proving that this
disposal of his sick was a premeditated plan, which he
wished to introduce into general practice. In vain Buonaparte
attempted to justify himself; the members sat petrified
with terror, and almost doubted whether the scene
passing before their eyes was not an illusion.â</p>

<p>Dr. Wittman assures his readers that whilst he was in
Egypt with the army, a man was pointed out to them as
having been the executioner of Napoleonâs commands to
poison the sick and wounded French soldiers in the hospitals
of Jaffa.</p>

<p>Barre says: âAlthough neither Sir Robert Wilson nor
Dr. Wittman mention the name of the worthy physician
who refused with horror, and of the infamous wretch, who
basely consented to become the executioner of the sick<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103">103</a></span>
soldiers, it is now well known that the former was the
worthy physician Dr. Desgenettes, and the latter, one
Rouyer, an infamous apothecary, who thus became the
murderer of his own countrymen, in compliance with the
wishes of a Corsican assassin.â</p>

<p>In a little periodical, called âRing the Alarum Bell!â
(which only ran four numbers), published in 1803, is the
following, written by a General Danican: âIn 1801, I met
at a lazaretto in Sicily, with a number of French Soldiers
just come from Alexandria. With one of them I contracted
habits of intimacy during my stay, and who frequently
related to me some curious particulars of the conduct
of BuonapartÃ© in Egypt.... Having been witness to
the poisoning scene at Caiffa he related to me the following
anecdote. A grenadier, who had lost two brothers, was
amongst the unfortunate wretches slightly affected with the
pestilential disease. From what he had previously observed
in the hospital, he had become more suspicious than his
companions in distress, and he had scarcely taken the
<i>Corsican physic</i>, than he immediately discharged it, made
his way out of the hospital, and escaping the guard, whom
he contrived to knock down, he gained the column under
the command of Kleber, at whose feet he threw himself,
and, in the intercession, almost of despair, conjured him to
let him mount one of the camels, describing what he had
escaped from, and venting the most energetic maledictions
on the <i>Poisoner in Chief</i>. The poor wretch, in the most
piteous manner, assured General Kleber that he would
keep at a distance from the army, so that no one should
be in any danger of catching his disorder, except the
camel. Kleber granted his request; the grenadier was
saved and recovered, and was alive when the English
landed under the brave Abercrombie.â</p>

<p>Now let us hear the Emperorâs side of the question,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104">104</a></span>
beginning with De Bourrienne. âOrders were given directly
to undermine the fortifications and blow them up; and, on
the 27th May, upon the signal being given, the town was
in a moment laid bare. An hour afterwards, the General
in Chief left his tent and repaired to the town, accompanied
by Berthier, some physicians and surgeons, and his
usual staff. I was also one of the party. A long and sad
deliberation took place on the question, which now arose,
relative to the men who were incurably ill of the plague,
or were at the point of death. After a discussion of the
most serious and conscientious kind, it was decided to
accelerate a few moments, by a potion, a death which was
inevitable, and which otherwise would be painful and
cruel....</p>

<p>âI cannot say that I saw the potion administered. I
should state an untruth if I did. I cannot name any
person concerned in the matter, without hazarding a misrepresentation.
But I well know that the decision was
come to after that deliberation, which was due to so important
a measure; that the order was given, and that the
infected are dead. What! shall that which formed the
subject of the whole conversation of the head quarters, on
the day after leaving Jaffa, and was spoken of without any
question of its reality; which was regarded by us as a
dreadful, but unavoidable, misfortune; which was never
mentioned in the army but as a fact, of which there was no
doubt, and only the details of which were inquired after&mdash;I
appeal to every honourable man who was present, for the
truth of what I state&mdash;shall that, I say, be now stigmatized
as a malignant calumny, fabricated to injure the reputation
of a hero, who, were this the only reproach that might be
addressed to him, would go down with little blemish on
his character, to posterity?â</p>

<p>Las Cases is specially wroth with Sir Robert Wilson,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105">105</a></span>
but, even he, cannot successfully whitewash his beloved
emperor. His attempted vindication is too long to be reproduced
<i>in extenso</i>, but it goes to prove how widely spread
in the army was the belief that the sick were hurried to their
rest at Jaffa. âA circumstance, which will not a little surprise
those who have yet to learn how little credit is due to
public report, and which will serve to show the errors that
may creep into history, is that Marshall Bertrand, who
was himself with the army in Egypt, (though certainly in
a rank which did not enable him to come into immediate
contact with the General in Chief) firmly believed, up to
the period of his residence at Saint Helena, the story of
poison having been administered to sixty invalids. The
report was circulated, and believed, even in our army;
therefore, what answer could be given to those who triumphantly
asserted, âIt is a fact, I assure you, I have it
from officers who served in the French army at the time.â
Nevertheless, the whole story is false. I have collected
the following facts from the highest source, from the
mouth of Napoleon himself.</p>

<p>â1st. That the invalids in question who were infected
with the plague, amounted, according to the report made
to the General in Chief, only to <i>seven</i> in number.</p>

<p>â2nd. That it was not the General in Chief, but a professional
man, who, at the moment of the crisis, proposed
the administering of opium.</p>

<p>â3rd. That opium was not administered to a single
individual.</p>

<p>â4th. That the retreat having been effected slowly, a
rear-guard was left behind in Jaffa for three days.</p>

<p>â5th. That on the departure of the rear guard, the
invalids were all dead, except one or two, who must have
fallen into the hands of the English.â</p>

<p>But Las Cases, in his zeal, tries to prove too much; for,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106">106</a></span>
in a later passage, he says, that since his return to Paris
he has had opportunities of conversing with those whose
situation and profession naturally rendered them the first
actors on the scene, and he finds âthat no order was given
for the administering of opium to the sick,â and âThat there
was not at the period in question, in the medicine chest of
the army, a single grain of opium for the use of the sick.â
So he admits that the emperor had the proposition made
to him, by a man who must have known he had not the
means to carry it out.</p>

<p>Is Barry OâMeara to be trusted? Let us hear what
his testimony is (also professedly from the emperorâs own
lips). ââPreviously to leaving Jaffa,â continued Napoleon,
âand after the greatest number of the sick and wounded
had been embarked, it was reported to me that there were
some men in the hospital so dangerously ill, as not to be
able to be moved. I ordered, immediately, the chiefs of
the medical staff to consult together upon what was best
to be done, and to give me their opinion on the subject.
Accordingly they met, and found there were seven or eight
men so dangerously ill, that they conceived it impossible
to recover, and also that they could not exist twenty-four
or thirty-six hours longer; that, moreover, being afflicted
with the plague, they would spread that complaint
amongst all who approached them. Some of them, who
were sensible, perceiving they were about to be abandoned,
demanded with earnest entreaties, to be put to
death. Larrey was of opinion that recovery was impossible,
and that those poor fellows could not exist many
hours; but as they might live long enough to be alive
when the Turks entered, and experience the dreadful
torments which they were accustomed to inflict upon their
prisoners, he thought it would be an act of charity to
comply with their desires, and accelerate their end by a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107">107</a></span>
few hours. Desgenettes did not approve of this, and
replied, that his profession was to cure the sick, and not to
despatch them.</p>

<p>ââLarrey came to me immediately afterwards, informed
me of the circumstances, and of what Desgenettes had
said; adding, that perhaps Desgenettes was right. âBut,â
continued Larrey, âthose men cannot live more than a few
hours, twenty-four, or thirty-six at most; and, if you will
leave a rear-guard of cavalry to stay and protect them
from advanced parties, it will be sufficient.â Accordingly
I ordered four or five hundred cavalry to remain behind,
and not to quit the place until all were dead. They did
remain, and informed me that all had expired before they
had left the town; but I have heard since, that Sydney
Smith found one or two alive when he entered it. This is
the truth of the business....</p>

<p>ââYou have been amongst the Turks, and know what
they are; I ask you now, to place yourself in the situation
of one of those sick men, and that you were asked which
you would prefer, to be left to suffer the tortures of those
miscreants, or to have opium administered to you?â I
replied, âMost undoubtedly I would prefer the latter.â
âCertainly, so would any man,â answered Napoleon; âif
my <i>own son</i> (and I believe I love my son as well as any
father does his child) were in a similar situation with
those men, I would advise it to be done; and, if so situated
myself, I would insist upon it, if I had sense enough,
and strength enough to demand it....</p>

<p>ââIf I had thought such a measure, as that of giving
opium, necessary, I would have called a council of war,
have stated the necessity of it, and have published it in
the order of the day.â He afterwards goes on to say that
if he had done so, some of his soldiers would have been
sure to have shot him.â</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108">108</a></span>
I have gone thus at length into these occurrences at
Jaffa, to show how widely spread was the belief in them,
and also to prove that these scandals were not of British
origin. Whatever amount of truth there may be in them,
readers must judge, as I have laid both sides fairly before
them. That there was foundation for them, there
can be no doubt&mdash;but we know that a tale does not lose in
telling.</p>

<p>The return to Cairo, and the battle of Aboukir, are
soon dismissed by the satirist, and not chronicled by the
caricaturist.</p>

<p>It is refreshing, and like going among green pastures and
cool streams, to leave for a while political caricature, with
its ambitions, and its carnage, and find a really funny
social skit, aiming at the follies of the times, even if it be
only in ridiculing extravagance in dress.</p>

<p>Exceedingly droll is a social caricature by Gillray
(August 15, 1799), where a courtly old gentleman of the
Court of Louis XVI. bows low, saying, âJe suis votre tres
humble serviteur,â whilst the ruffianly French âgentleman of
the Court of ÃgalitÃ©â replies with a sentence unfit for reproduction.
(See next page.)</p>

<p>LittrÃ©, in his magnificent dictionary, gives a very terse
definition of these âIncroyablesâ: âS. <i>m.</i> Nom donnÃ© aux
petit maÃ®tres sous le Directoire, parce qâuon les entendait
sâecrier propos, câest vraiment incroyable; et, parce
que leur costume Ã©tait tellement exagÃ©rÃ© quâil dÃ©passait la
croyance commune.â They were Napoleonâs detestation,
according to Madame Junot, and she describes them with
feminine minuteness. âThey wore grey greatcoats with
black collars and green cravats. Their hair, instead of
being <i>Ã  la Titus</i>, which was the prevailing fashion of the
day, was powdered, plaited, and turned up with a comb,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110">110</a></span>
while on each side of the face hung two long curls, called
dogâs ears (<i>oreilles de chien</i>). As these young men were
very frequently attacked, they carried about with them
large sticks, which were not always weapons of defence;
for the frays which arose in Paris at that time were often
provoked by them.â</p>

<p>Pardon must be begged for this digression, and the

<p>Napoleon left Egypt on August 23, 1799, and reached
France October 8 of that year. The causes for this step
will be detailed a little later on. Meanwhile the caricaturist
was watching events on the Continent, and, after his
lights, depicting them. With those not personally affecting
Napoleon we have nothing to do; and of him&mdash;Egypt
being a far cry&mdash;we have but few, until after his return,
when he was brought prominently before European notice.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111">111</a></span>
Gillray thought he saw his power declining, and on
September 1, 1799, he published âAllied Powers, Unbooting
ÃgalitÃ©.â In this picture Napoleon is being badly
treated. One foot is on a Dutch cheese, which a Hollander
is plucking away; a British tar has him fast round the
waist, and arms; whilst a Turk, of most ferocious description,
his dress being garnished with human ears,
is pulling his nose, and slashing him with his scimitar,
St. Jean dâAcre, which is reeking with blood. Prussia,
backed up by Russia, is drawing off Italy, which serves as
a boot for one leg, and, with it, a large quantity of gold coin.</p>

<p>The causes which induced Napoleon to leave Egypt
cannot better be made known, and understood, than by
quoting from De Bourrienne, who was an actor in this
episode. He says: âAfter the battle,<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">49</a> which took place on
the 25th July, Bonaparte sent a flag of truce on board the
English Admiralâs ship. Our intercourse was full of
politeness, such as might be expected in the communications
of the people of two civilised nations. The English
Admiral gave the flag of truce some presents, in exchange
for some we sent, and, likewise, a copy of the French
Gazette of Francfort, dated 10th June, 1799.<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">50</a> For ten
months we had received no news from France. Bonaparte
glanced over this journal with an eagerness which may
easily be conceived.</p>

<p>ââHeavens!â said he to me, âmy presentiment is verified:<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112">112</a></span>
the fools have lost Italy. All the fruits of our
victories are gone! I must leave Egypt!â</p>

<p>âHe sent for Berthier, to whom he communicated the
news, adding that things were going on very badly in France&mdash;that
he wished to return home&mdash;that he (Berthier) should
go along with him, and that, for the present, only he,
Gantheaume, and I, were in the secret. He recommended
him to be prudent, not to betray any symptoms of joy, nor
to purchase, or sell, anything.</p>

<p>âHe concluded by assuring him that he depended on
him. âI can answer,â said he, âfor myself and Bourrienne.â
Berthier promised to be secret, and he kept his word. He
had had enough of Egypt, and he so ardently longed to
return to France, that there was little reason to fear he
would disappoint himself by any indiscretion.</p>

<p>âGantheaume arrived, and Bonaparte gave him orders
to fit out the two frigates, the <i>Muiron</i> and the <i>CarrÃ¨re</i>,
and the two small vessels, the <i>Revanche</i> and the <i>Fortune</i>,
with a two monthsâ supply of provisions for from four,
to five, hundred men. He enjoined his secrecy as to the
object of these preparations, and desired him to act with
such circumspection that the English cruisers might have
no knowledge of what was going on. He afterwards
arranged with Gantheaume the course he wished to take.
Nothing escaped his attention.â</p>

<p>Bonaparte concealed his operations with much care;
but still some vague rumours crept abroad. General
Dugua, the commandant of Cairo, whom he had just left,
for the purpose of embarking, wrote to him on August 18
to the following <span class="locked">effect:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>âI have this moment heard, that it is reported at the
Institute, you are about to return for France, taking with
you Monge, Berthollet, Berthier, Lannes, and Murat.
This news has spread like lightning through the city, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113">113</a></span>
I should not be at all surprised if it produced an unfavourable
effect, which, however, I hope you will obviate.â</p>

<p>Bonaparte embarked five days after the receipt of
Duguaâs letter; and, as may be supposed, without replying
to it.</p>

<p>On August 18, he wrote to the Divan of Cairo as
follows: âI set out to-morrow for Menouf, from whence I
intend to make various excursions to the Delta, in order
that I may, myself, witness the acts of oppression which
are committed there, and to acquire some knowledge of
the people.â</p>

<p>He told the army but half the truth: âThe news from
Europe,â said he, âhas determined me to proceed to France.
I leave the command of the army to General Kleber. The
army shall hear from me forthwith. At present I can say
no more. It costs me much pain to quit troops to whom
I am so strongly attached. But my absence will be but
temporary, and the general I leave in command has the
confidence of the government, as well as mine.â</p>

<p>At night, in the dark, on August 23, he stole on board:
and who can wonder if the army expressed some dissatisfaction
at his leaving them in the lurch? From the many
works I have consulted, whilst writing this book, I can
believe the words of General Danican (who has been
before quoted) in âRing the Alarum Bell!â&mdash;âImmediately
after Buonaparteâs midnight flight from Egypt, with the
Cash of the army, he was hung in effigy by the Soldiers;
who, in dancing round the spectacle, sang the coarsest
couplets (a copy of which I have now in my possession)
written for the occasion, to the tune of the <i>Carmagnole</i>,
beginning: âSo, Harlequin has at length deserted us!&mdash;never
mind my boys, never mind; he will at last be really
hanged; he promised to make us all rich; but, instead, he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114">114</a></span>
has robbed all the cash himself, and nowâs gone off: oh!
the scoundrel Harlequin, &amp;c., &amp;c.ââ</p>

  <div class="caption">FLIGHT FROM EGYPT.</div></div>

<p>This charge against Napoleon, of running away with
the treasure-chests, is, like almost all the others, of French
origin. Hear what Madame Junot says, as it shows the
feeling of the French army on this point, that some one
had taken them (for Napoleonâs benefit): âA report was
circulated in the army that Junot was carrying away the
treasures found in the pyramids by the General in Chief.
He could not carry them away himselfâ (such was the
language held to the soldiers), âand so the man who
possesses all his confidence is now taking them to him.â
The matter was carried so far that several subalterns, and
soldiers, proceeded to the shore, and some of them went
on board the merchantman which was to sail with Junot
the same evening. They rummaged about, but found
nothing; at length they came to a prodigious chest, which
ten men could not move, between decks, âHere is the
treasure!â cried the soldiers; âhere is our pay that has
been kept from us above a year; where is the key?â Junotâs
valet, an honest German, shouted to them in vain, with all<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115">115</a></span>
his might, that the chest did not belong to his chenerÃ¢l.
They would not listen to him.</p>

<p>âUnluckily, Junot, who was not to embark till evening,
was not then on board. The mutineers seized a hatchet,
and began to cut away at the chest, which they would soon
have broken up, had not the shipâs carpenter come running
out of breath. âWhat the devil are you at?â cried he,
âmad fellows that you are: stop! donât destroy my chest&mdash;hereâs
the key.â He opened it immediately, and lo!&mdash;the
tools of the master carpenter.â</p>

<p>Barre, of course, alludes to this alleged robbery, and
Combe writes of his desertion of his troops as <span class="locked">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>NAPOLEONâS ARRIVAL IN PARIS&mdash;HIS POPULARITY&mdash;DISSOLUTION OF THE
COUNCIL OF FIVE HUNDRED&mdash;GRAPHIC DESCRIPTION OF THE SCENE&mdash;NAPOLEON,
SIÃYES, AND DUCOS NAMED CONSULS.</p></blockquote>

<p>Napoleon arrived in Paris at, for him, a happy moment,
for the Directory was then as good as defunct. There was
a feeling that a strong hand was needed to guide the affairs
of the nation, and Generals Moreau and Jubert had
already been offered the post of First Magistrate of the
Republic, and each had declined the honour. When
Napoleon landed, he was hailed as <span class="smcap">The Man</span>, and his
arrival was telegraphed to Paris, where it created an
immense sensation.</p>

<p>On the day after his arrival, he had an interview with
the Directors, to whom he explained the state of the army
in Egypt, and told them, how, having heard of the disasters
that had befallen their armies, he had returned home to
help them; but, although he was offered his choice of
commands, he would have none of them, and lived quietly
at Paris. The Council of Five Hundred even gave him a
public dinner<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">51</a>&mdash;but he was steadily working out the ends
he had in view.</p>

<p>What that was, was evident to the English people, for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118">118</a></span>
his aim was shown very amusingly in a caricature by an unknown
artist (November 1799). Napoleon, who, even then,
is represented as crowned, appears as a crocodile, in jackboots
and sword, squeezing the life out of two frogs, whilst the
dismay of the others is most comically rendered: a bodyguard
of crocodiles, in military uniform, back up their leader.</p>

<p>On November 9, he was made commandant of the
forces in Paris, which prepared him for the explosion of
the 18th Brumaire, year 8 (November 10, 1799). The
expulsion of the Council is most graphically told in the
âTimesâ of November 18, eight days after the event,
showing how slowly news travelled then. The scene must
have been painted by an eye-witness, for it gives the whole
previous debate&mdash;which at last turned on Napoleonâs
appointment as commandant. It is so well told, I cannot
help giving it in its entirety.</p>

<p>â<i>Grandmaison.</i> âWe are only offering crossing and
contradicting propositions, without coming to any decision:
I move that you begin by declaring the appointment of
Buonaparte to be unconstitutional.â</p>

<p>ââYes, yes,â was resounded from several parts of the Hall.</p>

<p>âL. (<i>ucien</i>) Buonaparte quitted the Chair, which he gave
up to Chazal, and said, âI entreat the Council calmly to
reflect on the commotion that has manifested itself. It
may not be needless to representâ&mdash;(Here he was interrupted
by a loud voice, who said, âDo not attempt to
amuse usâ)&mdash;âI proposeâ (continued Lucien Buonaparte)
âthat you summon the General who commands to appear
before you.â</p>

<p>ââWe do not acknowledge him,â exclaimed several
Members.</p>

<p>ââWhen cool considerationâ (observed Buonaparte)
âshall have stilled in your breasts the extraordinary emotion
which you have testifiedâ (<i>murmurs</i>), âyou will, perhaps, be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119">119</a></span>
sensible of the injustice done General Buonaparte. Whatever
may be the event, I now, in your presence, lay down
on the altar of the Country, the badge of Magistracy with
which the people had invested me.â</p>

<p>âOn saying these words, he laid down his badge of office
on the Presidentâs table: upon which the doors of the Hall
were opened, and twenty Grenadiers entered. They
advanced towards the Bureau, took L. Buonaparte into
custody, and, placing him in the midst of them, they conducted
him out of the Hall.</p>

<p>âThe Council was seized with extreme agitation. Cries,
vociferations, and tumultuous confusion, arose from the
Members suddenly quitting their places. Not a word
could be distinctly heard.</p>

<p>âGrandmaison, Blin, Delbrel, Bigonnet, Sherlock, Crochon,
and several other Members, pressed forward towards
the tribune.</p>

<p>âSherlock made an effort to speak, but could scarcely
make himself heard among the tumult. âI move,â said he,
âthat you call back your President, whose resignation you
have not accepted.â</p>

<p>ââHe could have done nothing better,â exclaimed several
Members, âthan to have given it in.â</p>

<p>âMeantime, at a distance was heard the sound of drums
that beat the <i>pas de charge</i>.... Soon after, for the third
time, the doors of the Hall were thrown open; and a third
time the spectators endeavoured precipitately to escape by
leaping out of the windows.</p>

<p>âAn officer came forwards, followed by a numerous
guard, exclaiming with a loud voice, â<i>General Buonaparte
orders the Hall to be cleared</i>.â Upon which, the troops
advanced into the Hall, the further part of which remained
occupied by the Deputies, who had not retired. The
soldiers suspended their march for a moment, in order to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120">120</a></span>
afford time for the Hall to be cleared. About a Dozen of
Members, among whom was Blin, remained near the
Tribune, or at the Bureau; one of them who was at the
Tribune, exclaimed,</p>

<p>ââWhat are you, Soldiers? are you anything else than
guardians of the National Representation; and do you
dare to menace its safety, to incroach on its independence&mdash;is
it thus that you tarnish the laurels which your courage
has won?â</p>

<p>âThis harangue was coldly listened to by the soldiers,
who advanced into the Hall with drums beating. The
Members who stood near the Bureau and the Tribune, were
at length obliged to yield their places to the soldiers, who
took possession of them. As the latter advanced into the
Hall, these members went out at the opposite door. In a
few minutes the Hall was completely cleared. It was then
five oâclock.</p>

<p>âSeveral members set out immediately for Paris, others
remained at St. Cloud to observe the deliberations of the
Council of Elders, and the extraordinary movement of the
troops who filled the square of the palace. From time to
time were heard the cries of <i>Vive Buonaparte!</i> <i>Vive la RÃ©publique!</i></p>

<p>âGeneral Buonaparte, on hearing the Council of Five
Hundred had withdrawn, advanced towards the soldiers
and harangued them.</p>

<p>âHe entreated them to remain calm, and to rest assured
that the good cause should triumph. They all answered
by shouts of <i>Vive Buonaparte!</i>â</p>

<p>The scene depicted in the accompanying illustration is
somewhat dramatically told by Napoleon himself in his
proclamation of 19th Brumaire: âI presented myself
before the Council of Five Hundred, alone, unarmed, my
head uncovered, just as the Ancients had received and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121">121</a></span>
applauded me. My object was to restore to the majority
the expression of its will, and to secure to it its power.</p>

<p>âThe stilettos which had menaced the Deputies, were
instantly raised against their deliverer. Twenty assassins
rushed upon me, and aimed at my breast. The grenadiers
of the legislative body, whom I had left at the door of the
hall, ran forward, and placed themselves between me and
the assassins. One of these brave grenadiers (Thorne<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">52</a>)
had his clothes pierced by a stiletto. They bore me off.â</p>

<p>Gillray, of course (November 21, 1799), touched on it,
but not very effectively, his picture âExit LibertÃ¨ a la
Francais!&mdash;or&mdash;Buonaparte closing the Farce of ÃgalitÃ©,
at Saint Cloud, near Paris, November 10, 1799,â being the
weakest caricature of any on this subject. Napoleon is
directing his troops, who are charging the Council with
fixed bayonets.</p>

<p>The Council met again at night, but simply to do as
they were bid. Thorne, the grenadier with the torn coat,
was decreed to have deserved well of his country, as were
also Napoleon, Lefebvre, Murat, Berthier, and many others.
Sixty-one members of the Council were expelled, and
Article two of the Resolution, passed that night, <span class="locked">says,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>âThe Legislative Body creates provisionally an Executive
Consular Committee, composed of Citizens Syeyes
and Roger Ducos, Ex-Directors, and Buonaparte, General.
They shall bear the name of Consuls of the French
Republic.â</p>

<p>Napoleon had now got his foot fairly on the ladder,

<p>It was not probable that Napoleon would rest contented
with the provisional position he occupied. A fresh
government had to be constituted, of which he must be the
head: and so the Constitution of December 13 was manufactured,
and afterwards passed into law. Article 23
provided, âThe sittings of the Senate are not to be public.â
Article 24, âThe Citizens SiÃ¨yes, and Roger Ducos, the
Consuls quitting their functions, are appointed members of
the Conservative Senate. They shall assemble along with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125">125</a></span>
the second and third Consuls nominated by the present
Constitution. These four Citizens shall appoint the
Majority of the Senate, which shall then complete itself,
and proceed to the elections entrusted to it.â</p>

<p>Article 39. âThe Government is entrusted to three
Consuls appointed for ten years, and indefinitely re-eligible.
Each of them is to be elected individually with
the distinct quality of Chief, Second, or Third Consul. The
first time the Third Consul shall only be named for five
years. For the present time General Bonaparte is appointed
Chief Consul, Citizen Cambaceres, now Minister of Justice,
Second Consul, and Citizen Lebrun, Member of the Committee
of Antients, Third Consul.â Article 41. âThe Chief
Consul is to promulgate the laws: he is to name and revoke
at pleasure the Members of the Council of State; the Ministers,
Ambassadors, and other principal foreign agents, the
officers of the army by land and sea, the members of local
administration and the Commissioners of the Government
at the Tribunals. He is to appoint all Judges, Criminal
and Civil, as well as Justices of the Peace, and the Judges
of Cassation, without the power of afterwards revoking
them.â Article 43. âThe salary of the Chief Consul shall
be 500,000 francs for the 8th yearâ (ending September 22,
1800). âThe salary of the other two Consuls shall be
equal to three-tenths of that of the first.â So that we see
Napoleon fully knew how to take care of himself.</p>

<p>On January 1, 1800, Gillray published âThe French
Triumvirate settling the New Constitutionâ&mdash;and mighty
wise they look. (See next page.)</p>

<p>In the year 1799, Consols ranged from 55 in January
to 62Â¼, the closing price in December. Bread, however,
was dear, the average of the quartern loaf being 13<i>d.</i></p>

<p>It was in the latter part of this year that Napoleon
notified to George the Third his elevation to the dignity<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126">126</a></span>
of First Consul, and appropriately chose Christmas Day on
which to date his letter, which breathed (sincerely or not)

<p class="center">Bonaparte, First Consul of the Republic, to His Majesty the King
of Great Britain and Ireland.</p>

<p class="sigright">Paris 5 NivÃ´se year VIII. of the Republic.</p>

<p>Called by the wishes of the French Nation to occupy the first
magistracy of the French Republic, I deem it desirable, in entering
on its functions, to make a direct communication to your Majesty.</p>

<p>Must The War, which for four years, has ravaged every part of
the world, be eternal? Are there no means of coming to an
understanding?</p>

<p>How can the two most enlightened nations of Europe, more
powerful and stronger than is necessary for their safety and independence,
sacrifice to the idea of a vain grandeur, the benefits
of commerce, of internal prosperity, and domestic happiness?
How is it they do not feel that peace is as glorious as necessary?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127">127</a></span>
These sentiments cannot be strangers to the heart of your
Majesty, who rules over a free nation, with no other view than to
render them happy.</p>

<p>Your Majesty will only see in this overture my sincere desire
to effectually contribute to a general pacification, by a prompt
step, free and untrammeled by those forms, which, necessary,
perhaps, to disguise the apprehensions of feeble states, only prove
in the case of strong ones, the mutual desire to deceive.</p>

<p>France and England, by abusing their strength, may for a long
time yet, to the misery of all other nations, defer the moment of
their absolute exhaustion; but I will venture to say that the fate
of all civilised nations, depends on the end of a war which envelopes
the whole world.</p>

<p>The British Government did not quite see it, but considered
that the claws of the French eagle required yet
more cutting. They had been partially operated on at
the Nile, and at Acre. Italy was no longer under French
rule. Suwarrowâs victories had severely crippled the
French, who were, besides, very weak financially. Add to
this, that there were 140,000 Austrians gathering along the
Rhine. But still it was judged they were yet too sharp for
the peace of Europe.</p>

Explanation.&mdash;Some horse dung being washed by the
current from a neighbouring dunghill, espied a number
of fair apples swimming up the stream, when, wishing to
be thought of consequence, the horse dung would every
moment be bawling out, âLack-a-day, how we apples
swim!â <i>See</i> Buonaparteâs âLetter to his Majesty,â and Mr.
Whitbreadâs âRemarks upon the Correspondence between

<p>This scandalous accusation is too contemptible to be
thought true for a moment; but I must reproduce it, to show
what was said of Napoleon in England. Yet, in a portion
of it, there is a small substratum of truth. Hear what De
Bourrienne says: âThe death of Desaix was not perceived
at the moment it took place. He fell without saying a
word, at a little distance from Lefebvre-Desnouettes. A
battalion-sergeant of the ninth brigade of light infantry,
commanded by Barrois, seeing him extended on the
ground, asked permission to pick up his cap. It was
found to be perforated behind; and this circumstance
leaves it doubtful whether Desaix was killed by some
unlucky inadvertency while advancing at the head of his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132">132</a></span>
troops, or by the enemy when turning towards his men to
encourage them.â</p>

<p>Other accounts speak of his being shot in the breast.</p>

<p>How Napoleon loved Desaix, is best told by them who
knew him well, and let them bear witness against this
gross calumny. De Bourrienne says: âAfter supper, the
First Consul dictated to me the bulletin of the battle.
When we were alone, I said to him, âGeneral, hereâs a fine
victory. You recollect what you said the other day, about
the pleasure with which you would return to France after
striking a grand blow in Italy: surely you must be satisfied
now?â&mdash;âYes, Bourrienne, I am satisfied. But Desaix!...
Ah, what a triumph would this have been if I could have
embraced him to-night on the field of battle!â As he
uttered these words, I saw that Bonaparte was on the
point of shedding tears, so sincere and profound was his
grief for the death of Desaix. He certainly never loved,
esteemed or regretted, any man so much.â</p>

<p>OâMeara writes: âAsked him if it were true that
Desaix had, a little before his death, sent a message of the
following purport to him: âTell the First Consul that I
regret dying before I have done sufficient to make my
name known to posterity.â Napoleon replied, âit was true,â
and accompanied it with some warm eulogiums on Desaix.â</p>

<p>As a matter of fact Napoleon could not sufficiently
honour the memory of his comrade, so highly did he estimate
him. He spoke, in his bulletins, of the irreparable
loss his death caused him; he took for his own aides-de-camp,
Rapp, and Savary, who had acted in this capacity
to Desaix. A medal was struck in his honour, his statue
should have been erected on the Place des Victoires,
solemn ceremonies were ordered, masses were said, and a
monument was raised, by subscription, on the Place
Dauphine, Paris.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133">133</a></span>
It is amusing to read in the newspapers of the day
(with the exception of the âTimesâ) the spiteful things said
against Napoleon. But Cobbett, in the âPorcupine,â outdoes
them all, and spits his venom on the most harmless deeds.
âThe late establishment of Soup shops in Paris, naturally
excites some curious ideas. Madame Bonaparte, their
patroness, who is also a sprig of nobility, seems in no
small degree attached to the ancient regimen; hence
probably her wish to revive soup meagre, frogs, &amp;c. Nor
is it less remarkable that the French should wish to
establish soup shops, just at the time when they were
falling into disuse in this country.â<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">54</a> âThe <i>Morning Post</i>
tells us that âthe Chief Consul has taken a thousand subscription
tickets for the <i>soup establishments</i> at Paris.â This
is at once a proof of that <i>plenty</i> which we have been told
exists in France, and of the Charity of the Chief Consul.
If ever there was a country more degraded than all others,
it is France. Should there be, amongst the people of that
country, one man left, who entertains antient notions,
what must be his mortification and shame to see his
countrymen not only ruled, but actually fed like paupers,
by a low bred upstart from the contemptible island of
Corsica! And this, ye gods! is the <i>Grand Nation</i>! This
is the nation who is to change the public law of Europe!
This is the nation to whom Britons are requested to bow
down their heads! To return to the â<i>soup establishments</i>,â
we should be glad to know how the Corsican came by the
money to purchase a thousand tickets. Was it part of the
dower which Barras gave him with his bride? We rather
think he wrung it from the hands of the sovereign people.
What a base, what a despicable, race of slaves! They
submit to assessments, forced loans, requisitions, and confiscations;
they see their treasure seized on by millions<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134">134</a></span>
upon millions, and they applaud the â<i>charity</i> and <i>generosity</i>â
of the plunderer in chief, because he bestows on them the
fractions in soup maigre!â<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">55</a></p>

<p>Cobbett did not write with ink, but with gall, and was
not at all particular as to the veracity of his statements.
Take the following examples:<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">56</a> â<i>Lucien Buonaparte</i> is
holden in detestation in France. His office, as Minister of
the Interior, gives him the command of very large sums,
which he wastes in every kind of dissipation, and in the
most scandalous manner, in order, forsooth! to support his
rank as a <i>Prince of the Blood</i>!!! He is protected by
the whole power of his brother, whose <i>vanity</i>, the leading
<i>foible</i> in his character, leads him to confer on the members
of his family, all the advantages and prerogatives of
Sovereign princes. This conduct has rendered him the
object of incessant ridicule, and considerably diminished
his popularity.</p>

<p>âAnother species of evil peculiar to a corrupt military
government, prevails in a very great degree, and has
become particularly offensive to the French, viz. the influence
and insolence of generals.</p>

<p>âAll the generals attached to Buonaparte, those who
supported him in his usurpation, and those who were with
him in Egypt, bear an exact resemblance to the minions
and favourites of the Roman Emperors. These men have
the public treasure almost entirely at their disposal.
General Lasnes, one of the Consulâs chief friends, spends
the enormous sum of <i>five hundred thousand livres</i> (upwards
of twenty thousand guineas!!!) a month, at Paris, where
he and his aids de camp occupy one of the most magnificent
<i>hotels</i> in that capital. Buonaparte, not being able to
supply his favourites with sufficient specie for defraying<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135">135</a></span>
their unbounded expences, grants them <i>congÃ©es dâexportation</i>,
i.e. an exclusive permission to export various articles
the exportation of which is prohibited by law; these <i>congÃ©es</i>
are sold to mercantile men, who purchase them at a
very high price.â</p>

<p>âTo the facts, which we stated on Monday, respecting
the prodigality of Buonaparte and his creatures, we may
add the instance of General Ney. This Republican Bashaw
has fixed his head-quarters at Neubourg, at the expence of
which place, his table is furnished at the rate of <i>ninety
pounds sterling a day</i>! The French have a proverb, the
truth of which they and their neighbours now experience
to their sorrow: âIl vaut mieux quâune citÃ© soit brÃ»lÃ©e,
qâun parvenu la gouverneâ&mdash;A city had better be burnt to
ashes, than submit to the rule of an upstart vagabond.â<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">57</a></p>

</div></div>
</div>

<p>The first plot was that of October 10, 1800, and it has,
certainly, somewhat of a police âget upâ about it. The
First Consul knew all about it through an ex <i>chef de
bataillon</i> named Harrel, who used to come every night to
De Bourrienne, and tell him what the so-called conspirators
had done. He supplied Harrel, at Napoleonâs request,
with money, &amp;c. Napoleon was never in any danger, and
four men perished by the guillotine.</p>

<p>Barre says: âStill the persons designed, and arrested,
on the very spot of the premeditated murder, were strictly
searched about their proper persons, and neighbouring
places, and not an arm, nor even a pin, was found. With
what, then, could those pretended conspirators commit a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138">138</a></span>
murder, since, at the very moment, and on the very spot
where it was to have been perpetrated, no kind of arms
were found about them?</p>

<p>âThat such was the case, it was asserted, and never
denied, in the course of the trial.</p>

<p>âThe only witness was one Harel, an acknowledged
spy of the police, holding the rank of Captain.</p>

<p>âAnd on the single evidence of a spy, devoted to, and
paid by, the police, four men (Arena, Ceracchi, Demerville,
and Topino-Lebrun,) were condemned to death....</p>

<p>âThose unfortunate men having appealed from such
iniquitous judgment, as grounded on many erroneous
statements, and irregular proceedings, the court of appeals
divided, when it was found that eight judges were for
repealing, and eight for confirming, the judgment.</p>

<p>âThe division being equal, five more judges were added
to the sixteen, when the iniquitous judgment was confirmed.â</p>

<p>The other attempt upon Napoleonâs life was genuine
enough. On December 24, 1800, Haydnâs Oratorio of
the âCreationâ was to be performed at the Opera. He
was sleepy, and disinclined to go, but was overpersuaded,
and went. Luckily his coachman was drunk, and drove
faster than usual. In the Rue St. Nicaise there was a
loud explosion, two or three seconds after he had passed
the place where it had occurred.</p>

<p>A barrel of gunpowder, surrounded by grapeshot, and
pieces of iron, was fixed in a cart, and fired when Napoleon
passed. He escaped, but twenty people were killed, and
fifty-three wounded, including St. Regent who fired the
train. The coachman was so drunk that he drove on,
thinking it was only a salute that had been fired. There
are several, and contradictory, versions of this event, but
this seems to be the most <span class="locked">authentic&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Cobbett, of course, improves the occasion.<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">58</a> âMiserable
slaves! For an instance of base flattery, surpassing anything
we have hitherto seen, take the following from the
<i>Chef du Cabinet</i>: âThe explosion of the infernal machine<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140">140</a></span>
broke <i>twenty-nine</i> pictures, out of <i>thirty</i>, which ornamented
an apartment in the street of St. Thomas. The single
picture which escaped, was that of the Chief Consul. One
would be ready to affirm (mark this) <i>that the same God,
who watches over the life of the first Consul, protected even his
likeness</i>â!!! What Emperor was it that talked of making
<i>his horse a Consul</i>? An English blood horse would be
disgraced by becoming the successor of Buonaparte.â</p>

<p>And again:<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">59</a> âBuonaparteâs embracing the Parisian

REJOICINGS.</p></blockquote>

<p>It is sad to take up the very first number of the âLondon
Gazetteâ for 1801, and find âA Proclamation for a general
Fast,â which was to be held on February 13, the reason
wherefore is stated thus: â<span class="smcap">We</span>, taking into Our most
serious consideration the heavy Judgments with which
Almighty God is pleased to visit the Iniquities of this
land, by a grievous Scarcity and Dearth of divers Articles
of Sustenance, and Necessaries of Life &amp;c.â</p>

<p>The war bore grievously on the Commons, and, consequently,
Napoleon was in like measure abhorred. Nothing
short of the thought of approaching famine could have
caused Parliament to pass, and the king give his royal
assent to,<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">60</a> âAn Act to prevent until the Sixth Day of
November, One Thousand Eight Hundred and One, and
from thence to the End of Six Weeks from the Commencement
of the then next Session of Parliament, the manufacturing
of any fine Flour from Wheat, or other Grain, and the
making of any Bread solely from the fine Flour of Wheat;
and to repeal an Act, passed in the Thirty-Sixth Year of
the Reign of His present Majesty, for permitting Bakers
to make and sell certain Sorts of Bread, and to make more
effectual Provision for the same.â This took effect on
January 31, 1801.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142">142</a></span>
âAn Act to prohibit, until the First Day of October,
One thousand eight hundred and one, and from thence to
the End of Six Weeks next after the then next Session of
Parliament, any Person or Persons from selling any Bread
which shall not have been baked Twenty-four Hours.â
This Act was 41 Geo. III. cap. 17, and it recites the
reason in the preamble: âWhereas it is expedient to
reduce as much as possible, at the present moment, the
consumption of Wheat flour. And whereas it appears a
considerable saving would arise if Bread was prohibited
from being sold until it had been baked a certain time, &amp;c.â
The penalties of non-compliance ranging from 5<i>s.</i> to 40<i>s.</i></p>

<p>Here is a receipt given for adulterated bread: âImprovement
of bread, with economy of flour, and saving of
expense:&mdash;Take one pound of ground rice, put it in cold
water sufficient to cover it, and something more, boil it,
and it will absorb all the water, and weigh four pounds;
mix four pounds of flour with it, knead them well together,
and lighten them with yeast, like common bread, and they
will produce ten pounds ten ounces of excellent bread,
which will not cost more than twopence halfpenny per
pound, and will save one half in the consumption of flour.
N.B. this bread will keep moist a week.â</p>

<p>When we remember that bad bread was on January 1,
1801, 1<i>s.</i> 9Â¼<i>d.</i> per quartern loaf, on March 5, 1<i>s.</i> 10Â½<i>d.</i>, and
although it dropped after harvest as low as 10Â¼<i>d.</i>, yet
closed December 31 at 1<i>s.</i> 0Â¼<i>d.</i>, and that this bad bread
had to be eaten stale, all through Boney, we cannot
wonder that the people did not love him. His direct
presence was brought home to all and every one daily, by
means of that most susceptible bodily organ, the stomach.
It was hitting John Bull in a very vulnerable part.</p>

<p>The war in Egypt still kept on, and in February reinforcements
of 15,330 men, under the command of Sir<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143">143</a></span>
Ralph Abercrombie, set sail in a fleet of 175 vessels or ships.
In March they defeated the French under Menon, the renegade,
but at the cost of the life of the brave Abercrombie.</p>

<p>On April 19, Rosetta surrendered to our forces, and on
June 27 Cairo capitulated, on condition that General
Belliard, with all his troops, arms, and baggage, should be
taken back to France. On their march back to the coast,
Menon, finding his cause hopeless, surrendered on the
same terms, and thus ended the French occupation of
Egypt.</p>

<p>With Napoleonâs concordat with the Pope we have
nothing to do, except that his satirists here did not forget
to contrast his attendance at the solemn <i>Te Deum</i> at Notre
Dame with his pseudo-Mahometanism in Egypt. What
more affected us, was the arming along the Channel coast,
and the Flotilla at Boulogne, which was to act as transport
for the army for the invasion of England. The French
themselves laughed at these little cockle-shells of boats,
<i>teste</i> Madame <span class="locked">Junot:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>âBoulogne was designated from the year 1801, as the
chief station of the enterprise against England. The
greatest activity suddenly prevailed in all ports of the
Channel; camps were formed on the coast, divisions of light
vessels were organised, and multitudes were built. The
Flotilla, as it was called, created apparently with the greatest
exertion, and all the apparatus of preparation, spread, as
was intended, alarm on the opposite shore. The Boulogne
Flotilla was composed of extremely light boats, so small,
that at Paris, where everything forms the subject of a jest,
they were called walnut shells. Brunet, who at this time
was a truly comic actor, performing in some piece which I
do not remember, was eating walnuts, the shells of which,
after a little preparation, he launched upon some water in
a tub by his side. âWhat are you doing?â said his fellow<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144">144</a></span>
actor. âMaking des pÃ©niches,â replied Brunet. This was
the name by which the flat-bottomed boats of the flotilla
were known at Paris. But poor Brunet was made to atone
by twenty-four hoursâ imprisonment for his unseasonble
joke on the Government; and the day after his release the
same piece was performed. When Brunet should have
made the interdicted reply, he was silent. The other actor
repeated the inquiry as to what he was doing. Still
Brunet made no answer, and the other with an air of
impatience proceeded: âPerhaps you do not know what
you are about?â âOh yes!â said Brunet, âI know very
well what I am about, but I know better than to tell.â
The laugh was general, and so were the applauses; and, in
truth, nothing could be more droll than the manner in
which this was uttered; Brunetâs countenance in saying
it was of itself sufficient to provoke universal hilarity.â</p>

<p>But, in very truth, John Bull was not much frightened:
there was Nelson, and his fleet, and people had great faith
in them. But Nelson could do little against this passive
fleet. On August 3 he bombarded Boulogne, sunk five
gunboats, and damaged others; and on the 15th of the
same month he tried to capture, or destroy, these gunboats,
but was unsuccessful in his attempt, as the French
had chained them to the shore.</p>

<p>We now come to the principal event of the year, the
Peace&mdash;over which there was much coquetting. As early
as March, Lord Hawkesbury, the then Secretary of State
for Foreign Affairs, addressed a letter to M. Otto, signifying
King Georgeâs desire to enter into negotiations for the
restoration of peace.</p>

<p>These negotiations for peace were naturally noticed,
and one very good etching, by Roberts, âNegotiation See
Saw,â shows Napoleon and John Bull engaged in that pastime
seated on a plank âPeace or War.â Bonaparte says,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145">145</a></span>
âThere Johnny, now Iâm down, and you are up&mdash;then I
go up and you go down Johnny&mdash;so we go on.â John
Bull does not enjoy the situation so much, but grumbles,
âI wish you would settle it one way or other, for if you
keep bumping me up and down in this manner I shall be
ruined in Diachilem Plaster.â</p>

<p>A somewhat elaborate etching, also by Roberts (no
date, 1801), depicts âJohn Bullâs Prayer to Peace, or the
flight of Discord.â He is on his knees praying the following
to Peace: âSublime Descendant of Happiness, incline
thine ear to the Petition of thy poor Patient, worn out
oppressed I. Bull, who humbly prayeth thee that thou
wouldâst in the first place exert thy influence, and be the
means of restoring to me again those lost Liberties and
Privileges I have been so basely robâd of, and that you
wouldâst be pleased also to put a speedy stop to cruel
monopolizing, and eâer it be long, send me thy attendant
Plenty, to comfort me and my long suffering numerous
Family, and may that horrid Demon Discord never return
again.â Peace, whom the eye of Providence watches over,
replies: âThy Prayer shall be fulfillâd, Plenty awaits thee
with all her blessings, her pace is slow but sure.â Bonaparte
and Pitt, who is represented as covered with serpents,
are retreating.</p>

<p>On October 1, preliminary articles of peace with France
were signed at Lord Hawkesburyâs office at Downing
Street, by his Lordship, and M. Otto on the part of the
French Government, and great were the rejoicings at the
event, although not so great as they might have been.
The âTimesâ of October 3 says: âThe public were so impatient
to express their feelings on the occasion of the News
of the Preliminaries of Peace being signed, that almost all
the public streets were illuminated last night. This was
evidently not the wish of the Government, who have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146">146</a></span>
deferred a general illumination until the ratification of them
comes back from France. Accordingly, none of the Public
Offices were illuminated, nor either of the Theatres. The
ratification of the Preliminaries is expected from Paris on
Tuesday next.â</p>

<p>No wonder âthe public were so impatient to express
their feelings,â their joy must have been so great. Long-suffering,
they had borne the burden and heat of a long
war, cheerfully too, and gladly must they have welcomed
its conclusion.</p>

<p>In Paris the joy was the same. The âTimes,â October
10, says: âThe Intelligence ... was announced to the
inhabitants of Paris by discharges of Artillery, and was
proclaimed by torch light throughout the streets. At night
there was a general illumination. Never was joy more
fervently expressed.â</p>

<p>One of the most practical tests of renewed confidence
was the great variation of 3 per cent. Consols&mdash;in September
58Â¼; in October 69Â½.</p>

<p>On October 10 came the preliminaries, ratified. Let
us see the âTimesââ account:&mdash;âLondon October 12th. On
Saturday morning, at ten oâclock, General Daurostan,<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">61</a> <i>Chef
de Brigade</i> in the Artillery, and Aide de Camp to General
Bonaparte, arrived at M. Ottoâs house in Hereford Street,
with the ratification of the French Government of the
Preliminaries of Peace signed on the 1st inst. between
Lord Hawkesbury and M. Otto in Downing Street.</p>

<p>âThe Preliminaries were ratified in Paris on the 5th;
but General Daurostan was not dispatched till Wednesday
evening, in order to give time for a magnificent gold box
to be made, in which the ratification was enclosed to Lord
Hawkesbury. The General was also delayed by his carriage
breaking down upon the road.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147">147</a></span>
âAfter breakfasting at M. Ottoâs, the General, accompanied
by the Minister, and Mr. St. John (Mrs. Ottoâs
brother), proceeded to <i>Reddishâs</i> Hotel, in St. Jamesâs
Street, where he dressed, and afterwards went to Downing
Street. On their way thither, the populace took the horses
from the carriage, and drew it through the principal
streets. As soon as the Ratifications had been exchanged,
Lord Hawkesbury sent a letter to the Lord Mayor....
General Daurostan cannot fail to communicate to his
Court the very flattering manner in which he had been
received in London. His carriage having been drawn to
St. Jamesâs Street, he alighted and came forward to the
window, and bowed to the populace. On his way to
Downing Street, they drew his carriage through the Park.
Lord St. Vincent happening to be at the garden-gate of
the Admiralty, the mob gave the gallant Admiral three
hearty cheers, who, in return, recommended them to take care
of the strangers, and not to overturn the carriage.... It
is understood that there will be another illumination this
evening. The Bank and Post Office have given notice of
their intending to do so.â</p>

<p>Cobbett foamed at the mouth over this Peace, and his
utterances are so caustic as to be well worth reproduction.<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">62</a>
âWe request our readers to observe, that henceforth we
shall be very particular in what we say about the most
illustrious Sovereign Consul Buonaparte. Oh! how we
shall extol him! We shall endeavour to give our readers
the earliest information, when he rises, breakfasts, dines,
sups, and spits. With all reverence, we shall treat of his
lovely, chaste, and bonny Queen&mdash;thus by way of a touch:</p>

<p>âIt is with superlative pleasure we inform our readers,
that the last news from France represents the health of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148">148</a></span>
the First Consul to be improving. This glory of the
world, is returned to his country palace at Malmaison.</p>

<p>But it was after October 10, when the Ratification had
arrived, that Cobbettâs wrath boiled over, and he appears at
his finest. In the number for October 12, he gives vent to
his impassioned feelings in words like these:<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">63</a> âOn Saturday
last, such a scene was exhibited in this metropolis, as we
never expected to have lived to witness, and having
witnessed it, we care not how soon we resign our existence!
... a vile degraded rabble, miscalled Britons, took
the horses out of the carriage which contained the two
French Citizens, Otto and Lauriston&mdash;the latter of whom
they mistook for the brother of Buonaparte&mdash;and dragged
it from Oxford Street to Downing Street; then back
through the Park, and, not content with taking the usual
carriage road, dragged it through the Mall, a place appropriated,
exclusively, as a carriage road, to the use of the
<span class="smcap">Royal Family</span>!!!â</p>

<p>But Cobbett had good reason to be sore, for the mob had
smashed the windows of his dwelling-house in Pall Mall,
and at his office in Southampton Street, because he would
not illuminate; so he takes his revenge in a peculiar manner.
âHe did not know that there existed in the country,
any force whatever, to compel his Majestyâs subjects to
exhibit, at night, manifestations of joy at an event which,
in the morning, he had stated his reasons for believing to be
a subject of deep concern. But he has unfortunately found
himself mistaken; and he is, therefore, under the necessity
of apprizing his readers, that, until the principles of the
British Constitution, and the laws of the realm, which have
ever been objects of his fervent admiration, and most
zealous support, can rise superior to the destructive rage of
a senseless and infuriate rabble; until he can derive that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149">149</a></span>
protection from the Police of the Country, which every
subject has a right to claim, but which he has, hitherto,
been unable to obtain; until, in short, that â<i>tumult</i> of
exultation,â and that â<i>delirium</i> of joy,â which a Ministerial
writer so emphatically described, and so earnestly wished,
might <i>increase</i>, shall have subsided, the publication of The
Porcupine will cease, and the mob be left to exercise their
vengeance on an empty office.â</p>

<p>But he did not long leave the populace thirsting for his
utterances, for the paper was resumed on October 15.</p>

<p>THE PEACE OF AMIENS&mdash;CESSION OF TRINIDAD AND CEYLON&mdash;INTERNATIONAL
VISITS&mdash;FOXâS TRIP TO FRANCE, AND RECEPTION BY
NAPOLEON.</p></blockquote>

<p>An unknown artist, probably Ansell, produced on October
26, 1801, a caricature of âThe Child and Champion of
Jacobinism new Christened (vide Pittâs Speech).â Bonaparte
is bending over a font, which, is supported by Egyptian
sphinges, whilst a bishop calls out, âName this Child.â Addington
and Pitt are the godfathers, and Lord Hawkesbury
is the godmother. Pitt replies, âDeliverer of Europe and
Pacificator of the World.â Addington says, âI hope he will
abolish the Slave Tradeâ; and the godmother mentions,
âYou need not say anything about the march to Paris.â</p>

<p>Gillray (November 9, 1801) gives us a very elaborate
picture of âPolitical Dreamings&mdash;Visions of Peace!&mdash;Perspective
Horrors!â Windham, who was the leader of the war
party, is asleep, and his dreams are full of incident&mdash;too full,
indeed, to recapitulate here. But the principal scene in the
sleeping manâs vision is Napoleon dragging to the guillotine
by a halter, Britannia, whose trident is broken, as, also
is her shield.</p>

<p>âThe Balance of Power,â by Ansell (December 1, 1801),
shows a pair of scales, in which Bonaparte weighs down Pitt
and the Lord Chancellor. Pitt ruefully exclaims, âSo this is
the Balance of Power we have been making such a fuss about&mdash;a
pretty piece of business we have made of it. Curse
that sword of his, âtis that has made us kick the Beam.â</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151">151</a></span>
Hostilities with France having ceased with the ratification
of the preliminaries of peace, there was but little caricaturing
of Napoleon, and none of an offensive character.
Napoleon occupied his time in attending to home affairs, as
also did the British Government. But the peace was not
absolutely concluded, and much diplomatic wrangling took
place, as usual, before the Peace of Amiens was really
signed on March 27, 1802. Its principal articles must be
briefly enumerated here, as they will be found of use in
understanding forthcoming caricatures.</p>

<div id="ip_151" class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
  <img src="images/i_151.jpg" width="600" height="335" alt="" /></div>

<p>England restored to France, Spain, and Batavia, all the
possessions which had been occupied or conquered during
the war, with the exception of Trinidad and Ceylon.
Malta was to be restored to the Order of St. John of Jerusalem&mdash;the
British troops to evacuate the island within
three months, or sooner; but Malta was to be independent,
such independence being guaranteed by the Great Powers,
and the ports to be open to the vessels of all nations, with
the exception of those belonging to the Barbary Powers.
These are the principal articles necessary for us to bear in
mind.</p>

<p>Due credit was given to Bonaparteâs astuteness, and
our plenipotentiary, Lord Cornwallis, was considered no
match for him.</p>

<p>The Caricature year of 1802 seems to open with one<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152">152</a></span>
by Ansell (January 9), âA Game at Chessâ between Bonaparte
and Lord Cornwallis. Bonaparte says, âCheck to
your King. Remember this is not the first time, and I
think a very few ManÅuvres more will compleatly convince
you that I am better acquainted with the Game I
am playing, than you are aware of.â Cornwallis, tearing
his hair, exclaims, âCurse it, I shall lose this game. You
are too much for me.â</p>

<p>This was followed by another from the same pencil
(February 8), called âCross examination,â where Lord
Cornwallis is button-holing Bonaparte, and saying, âThere
is great delay in our negociation comeing to a conclusion,
and I understand our People are very uneasy lest you
should be Humbugging us&mdash;Your fleet having sailâd, has
given cause for many conjectures, and to tell you the
truth it puzzles me a little to know what your intention is.â
Bonaparteâs reply is plain and simple, âI have to tell you,
Sir, that I do not desire to give you the information you
seem to wish for, and whether I sign or not, is of little
consequence to the Republican government; our fleet I
am in hopes will pick up something.â</p>

<p>In March 1802 Woodward produced a somewhat
dreary picture called âThe National Instituteâs first Interview
with their President.â Napoleon, seated under a
canopy, says to Sheridan, Fox, Bedford, and Burdett,
âGentlemen, you are welcome, and I invite you to the
Honors of the sitting.â Sheridan, who is kneeling, holds a
phial and box in his hands, and begs that Napoleon will
âBe pleased to accept some true poetic Tincture, and a
small Box of Pizarro<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">64</a> Pills.â Fox, who has a money bag
under his arm, says, âI have brought a pound and a half
of Patriotism for your eminence.â The Duke of Bedford
opines that âHeâll not be displeased with a few Bedford<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153">153</a></span>
biscuits;â and Burdett, with his hair, as usual, combed
over his eyes, refers to his present, âI have brought him a
Phial of Genuine Bastile Balsam.â</p>

<p>But when once the peace was signed, much show was
made of shaking hands and being friends. Englishmen
went over to France in numbers; Frenchmen reciprocated,
but not to the same extent. This feeling is shown by the
caricaturist, for on April 14, 1802, was published (artist
unknown) a picture entitled âA Peaceable Pipe, or a Consular
Visit to John Bull.â Napoleon and John Bull are in
amicable converse, smoking, and drinking beer. John Bull
says, âHereâs to you, Master Boney Party; come, take
another whiff, my hearty!â To this hospitable invitation
Napoleon replies, âJe vous remercie, John Bull, I think Iâll
take another pull.â Mrs. Bull is hard at work mending
Johnâs breeches, which are wofully dilapidated: says she,
soliloquising, âNow we are at Peace, if my Husband does
take a drop extraordinary I donât much mind, but when
he was at war, he was always grumbling. Bless me, how
tiresome these old breeches are to mend; no wonder he
wore them out, for he had always his hands in his pockets
for something or other.â</p>

<p>As before said, with the peace came mutual intercourse
between England and France, and there is a picture by
Ansell (May 14, 1802), which represents âA Trip to Paris,
or Iohn Bull and his Spouse, invited to the Honors of the
Sitting!!â Napoleon receives John Bull and Ireland, and
when seated, Napoleon addresses them thus: âIndeed, Mr.
Bull, I am quite charmed with you&mdash;there is something so
easy and polite in your manners.â</p>

<p>John Bull, however, is not to be taken in by such palpable
â<i>blarney</i>,â and replies, âCome&mdash;come Mounseer Bonny
party, thatâs all gammon dâye see. D&mdash;n me if I know
more about politeness than a Cow does of a new shilling!!â<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154">154</a></span>
Ireland looks very angrily at her spouse, and remonstrates:
âFor shame, Mr. Bull, what will the Jontleman think of
your Blarney about gammon and cows, and Bodder and
nonsense; by St. Patrick, I must send you to Kilkenny to
larn good breeding.â</p>

<p>Some of these caricatures were rather dreary; take, for
example, âThe Consular Warehouse or a Great Man nailâd
to the Counterâ (Cawse, May 20). Napoleon is keeping a
shop, selling, among other things, âPreserved Promises,
Pickled Piety from Rome, Oil of Lodi, Marengo Olio, Bullet
Bolusses advice gratis. N.B. One Pill is a dose, also Islands
for Home Consumption Martinique&mdash;St. Lucia.â John Bull
has just bought two, paid for in good hard cash, and takes
his goods home with him. Under one arm he carries the
âIsland of Indemnity, ci-devant Ceylonâ&mdash;under the other
is the âIsland of Security, ci-devant Trinidad.â They hardly
seem to be John Bullâs idea of a bargain, for he is saying,
âThey be very light to be sure&mdash;but harkee, my worthy,&mdash;youâll
not forget to carry on a little trade with the Old
Shop; if you donât, you know, a Rowland for an Oliver,
thatâs all.â Napoleon, however, reassures him with âWeâll
not talk of that at present, Mr. Bull; all you have to do,
is to take care of your new Islands; mind you donât tumble
down, and break them, before you get home&mdash;They are
very brittle, but a very good article for all that.â</p>

<p>As the year grew older, the <i>entente cordiale</i> grew colder.
Suspicions of Napoleonâs intentions were aroused, and
Malta was not evacuated as per treaty. One or two warning
caricatures, stormy petrels, made their appearance, and
in the autumn of this year appeared âThe Corsican Conjurer
raising the plagues of Europe.â He is shewn with
huge cocked hat and an ample robe, which is held up by
the Devil, who encourages him, âThatâs right my fine fellow&mdash;If
you donât kick up a pretty dust in the world, never<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155">155</a></span>
trust the Devil again&mdash;thatâs all.â Napoleon is waving a
rod over a caldron, in which are serpents, and a devil, the
steam from which is labelled, in different clouds, âAnarchy,
Pride, Murder, Confusion, Treason, War, Plunder, Revenge,
Massacre, Avarice, Cruelty, Usurpation, Hatred, Horror,
Envy, Blasphemy, Malice, Craft, Falsehood, and Terror.â</p>

<p>There is another one, âParcelling out John Bull,â which
is a queer conceit. Napoleon has a huge pair of Compasses,
with which he is measuring John Bull&mdash;congratulating
himself that âHe really will make a pretty addition
to my departments&mdash;he cuts out extremely well indeed.â
There is the Wig Department, Department of the Head,
Arm Department, Department of the Body, Fob Department,
Breeches pocket Department, Right and Left Leg
Divisions. But John Bull assures his friend, in no kindly
spirit, âHarkee Young one, you have forgotten the Fist
Department, and if you donât take away your d&mdash;d Compasses,
Iâll give you a relish of it. Cut me out, indeed!
why, Iâll fight you with one hand tied behind me.â This
caricature is neither signed nor dated, but it was undoubtedly
issued in the autumn of 1802.</p>

<p>We have seen that it was fashionable for Englishmen
to run over to France after the conclusion of peace, and
Charles James Fox was no exception to the rule; but he
had to wait a little, until after the Westminster election,
when, on July 15, he was returned head of the poll. He
did not long delay the trip, and on July 29 he set out on
his journey, accompanied by his wife, the Hon. St. Andrew
St. John (afterwards Lord St. John) and a young Irishman
named Trotter,<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">65</a> who wrote an exhaustive account of their
journey. On the 4th of August, Napoleon had been elected<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156">156</a></span>
Consul for life, a step which might probably tend to consolidate
peace, and which rendered his position equal to
any other European sovereign. When Fox reached Paris,
it was rumoured that this was only preliminary to his taking
a higher rank, with the title of Emperor of the Gauls. Just
then, Englishmen were in great favour at Paris, and Foxâs
arrival created a great commotion. All vied with each
other to pay him attention, and it was settled he should be
presented to the First Consul at his next <i>levÃ©e</i>, which took
place on September 3.</p>

<div id="ip_156" class="figcenter" style="width: 418px;">
  <img src="images/i_156.jpg" width="418" height="600" alt="" /></div>

<p>Caricaturists, like poets, must needs be allowed some
licence, and Gillray (November 15), in his picture of the
âIntroduction of Citizen Volpone,<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">66</a> and his Suite, at Paris,â
draws slightly upon his imagination as to Napoleonâs state
at this reception; still the allegorical globes, and the introduction
of RÃ»stan the Mameluke, add a fictitious dignity
to the picture.</p>

<p>The actual scene, as it was viewed by an eye-witness,<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">67</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157">157</a></span>
is thus described: âWe reached the interior apartment,
where Buonaparte, First Consul, surrounded by his generals,
ministers, senators, and officers, stood between the second
and third Consuls, Le Brun and CambacÃ©rÃ¨s, in the centre
of a semicircle, at the head of the room! The numerous
assemblage from the <i>Salle des Ambassadeurs</i>, formed into
another semicircle, joined themselves to that, at the head
of which stood the First Consul.â</p>

<div id="ip_157" class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
  <img src="images/i_157.jpg" width="600" height="412" alt="" /></div>

<p>Gillrayâs portrait of Charles James Fox is not very
much exaggerated. Let us hope that of Mrs. Fox is. This
lady, although she was married to Fox on September 28,
1795, was never introduced to his friends as his wife until
this journey. She was always believed to be his mistress,
Mrs. Armistead.<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">68</a> She made him a good and loving wife,
and he was very fond of her.</p>

<p>Trotter describes the actual presentation thus: âBuonaparte,
of a small, and by no means commanding figure,
dressed plainly, though richly, in the embroidered consular
coat, without powder in his hair, looked like
a private gentleman, indifferent as to dress, and devoid
of all haughtiness in his air.... The moment the
circle was formed, Buonaparte began with the Spanish<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158">158</a></span>
Ambassador, then went to the American, with whom
he spoke some time, and so on, performing his part
with ease, and very agreeably; until he came to the
English Ambassador, who, after the presentation of some
English Noblemen, announced to him Mr. Fox! He was
a good deal flurried, and after indicating considerable
emotion, very rapidly said, âAh! Mr. Fox! I have heard
with pleasure of your arrival&mdash;I have desired much to see
you&mdash;I have long admired in you the orator, and friend of
his country, who in constantly raising his voice for peace,
consulted that countryâs best interests&mdash;those of Europe&mdash;and
of the human race. The two great nations of Europe
require peace;&mdash;they have nothing to fear; they ought to
understand and value one another. In you, Mr. Fox, I
see, with much satisfaction, that great statesman who
recommended Peace, because there was no just object
of war; who saw Europe desolated to no purpose, and
who struggled for its relief.â</p>

<p>âMr. Fox said little, or rather, nothing, in reply,&mdash;to a
complimentary address to himself, he always found invincible
repugnance to answer; nor did he bestow one word
of admiration or applause upon the extraordinary and elevated
character who addressed him. A few questions and
answers relative to Mr. Foxâs tour terminated the interview.â</p>

<p>Other caricaturists took the matter up, for Foxâs visit
to Paris was naturally commented on; and there is an
engraving by Ansell (November 8, 1802), âEnglish Patriots
bowing at the Shrine of Despotism.â These âPatriotsâ are
Fox, Erskine, and Combe, the brewer, who was Lord
Mayor. They are represented as bowing in the most lowly
fashion&mdash;so low, indeed, that Fox has burst his trousers
behind; and with one voice they assure Napoleon that they
âare, with the highest consideration, your Super Royal<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159">159</a></span>
Consulshipâs most Devoted, most Obsequious, and most
honored Servants.â Bonaparte, seated in almost regal
state, criticises them: âOh, from the World! OâConnorâs
friends&mdash;Fox, ha! how old are you? A Brewer; Lord
Mayor, ha! great pomp. Mr. Brief, ha! a great Lawyer
can talk well. There, you may go.â</p>

<p>Thus we see they did not quite get hold of the right
version of this interview, as âTaking leaveâ was satirised by
a nameless artist (November 12, 1802), and represents
Fox bowing very humbly to the First Consul, who is
crowned with deathâs-head and cross-bones, daggers,
pistols, and swords, and regards him in an extremely
haughty manner.</p>

<p>LORD WHITWORTH AS PLENIPOTENTIARY&mdash;HIS EQUIPAGE&mdash;ENGLISH VISIT
PARIS&mdash;UNSETTLED FEELING&mdash;NAPOLEON BEHAVES RUDELY TO LORD
WHITWORTH.</p></blockquote>

<p>In June, Lord Whitworth was appointed ambassador
extraordinary, and minister plenipotentiary, to the French
Republic, and the state he then kept up was a striking
contrast to the plainness of Republican equipages. It was
different under the Empire; but then the word Citizen had
not been dropped, and there was a certain affectation of
simplicity. The English attracted great attention by the
splendour of their equipages, and there is a caricature
(nameless, December 14, 1802) of âLord Whitworthâs
Coachman at Paris.â His get-up is, certainly, âexceeding
magnifical,â and is the wonder of the Parisians. It is
almost too much for his equanimity, for he is shown as
saying, âHow the Mounseers stare at me! D&mdash;n me, if I
donât think they take me for the Ambassador.â</p>

<p>The effects of the peace were hardly realisable for a
time, and Woodward gives us an amusing caricature of the
state of the empire (December 20, 1802). It is called âA
Peep at the Lion,â which is supposed to be on show. Outside
the Exhibition Pitt is inviting Europe, generally, to
âWalk in Ladies and Gentlemen, and see the famous Lion.
Though I have some share in the concern, I have nothing
to do with showing him, I assure you&mdash;I am not his keeper;
the Lion I used to show was very fierce, but this is quite quiet
and peaceable.â Inside, the Lion is shewn as lying down,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161">161</a></span>
but with one eye open, Napoleon patting him on the head,
saying, âPoor fellow, poor fellow, what a beautiful Animal,&mdash;how
sound he sleeps.â But the Chancellor, Lord Eldon,
warns him, âYou had better not be too free with him Sir,
In case of an accident. He is now asleep with one eye, and
awake with the other.â</p>

<div id="ip_161" class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
  <img src="images/i_161.jpg" width="600" height="525" alt="" /></div>

<p>At the opening of the year 1803, although the storm
clouds of war were ominously gathering, yet all seemed
peace. The English enjoyed the rare treat of visiting
France, and, generally, being of the better class, were well
received. The year opens in a kindly spirit with âThe first
kiss these ten Years! or the meeting of Britannia and Citizen
FranÃ§oisâ (Gillray, January 1, 1803), which is a remarkably
good caricature. Britannia, owing to the peace, has
grown prosperous, and stout; her trident and shield are
put away in a corner, and the portraits of Napoleon and
George the Third repose, in loving juxtaposition, on the
wall, intertwined with palm-branches. Says Citizen FranÃ§ois
(his sword and cocked hat being laid aside), âMadame,
permettez me to pay my profound esteem to your engaging
person! and to seal on your divine Lips my everlasting attachment.â
Madame Britannia replies, âMonsieur, you are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162">162</a></span>
so truly a well bred Gentleman! and thoâ you make me
blush, yet you kiss so delicately, that I cannot refuse you;
thoâ I was sure you would deceive me again!!!â</p>

<p>A most amusing picture (Gillray, January 1, 1803) is
that called âGerman Nonchalance, or the vexation of Little
Boney. vide the Diplomatiqueâs late Journey through Paris.â
It represents the Austrian ambassador being driven furiously
through Paris, his luggage being directed âÃ  Londres.â</p>

<p>With the utmost <i>insouciance</i>, he is taking a pinch of
snuff, calmly regarding Napoleon, who is standing on some
steps, and is in a fearful rage. With arms and legs outstretched,
and his hat fallen off, he yells out, âHa, diable!
va tâen, Impertinent! va tâen! is dere von Man oh Earth
who not worship little Boney? Soldats! aux Armes! revenge!
ah! Sacre Dieu, je suis tout tremblant.â The
soldiers, however, although preparing to draw their swords,
do not appear to be particularly anxious to avenge their
insulted leader.</p>

<p>This incident arose from the Austrian minister neglecting<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163">163</a></span>
to pay his respects to the First Consul, whilst passing
through Paris.</p>

<p>As an evidence of the uneasiness of public political feeling,
take the following. In January 1803 was published a
caricature by Raymond, called âLeap Frog.â Napoleon
has already jumped over the bowed backs of Holland and
Spain. The poor Dutchman exclaims, âHe has left the
Swiss and Italians a Mile behind&mdash;and as for me he has
knocked my hat off and broken my pipe&mdash;pretty encouragement
this to play at Leap-frog.â The don ruefully says
that âBy St. Jago&mdash;my back is almost broken.â Napoleon
is now jumping over Hanover, who plaintively asks, âWhy
did I submit to this?â but the conqueror only says, âKeep
down your head Master Hanoverian, my next leap shall be
over John Bull.â But that individual, who looks uncommonly
belligerent, with clenched fists, exclaims, âIâll be d&mdash;d
if you do Master Corsican.â</p>

<p>The English Government, seeing how Napoleon was
aggrandising himself, and seeing also that this country, alone,
could save the liberty of Europe, did not hurry to conform
with the treaty of Amiens, and surrender all the advantages
gained by the late long struggle; and although, with reluctance,
the Cape, and other Batavian settlements, were given
up, excuses were always to be found for not evacuating
Malta.</p>

<p>On January 25, Lord Whitworth and Talleyrand had an
interview, and the latter, after bitterly complaining of the
licence of the British press, which he said ought to be curbed,
or suppressed, asked plainly what were the intentions of
the British Government with regard to Malta? It is to this
interview, probably, that the following caricature owed its
existence. How Cobbett lashed Addington, for his nepotism,
in his âAnnual Registerâ!!</p>

<p>âThe Evacuation of Maltaâ (Gillray, February 9, 1803)<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164">164</a></span>
is vividly, almost too graphically, depicted. Ferocious little
Bonaparte has hold of poor frightened Addington by his
necktie, and, by flourishing his enormous sword, compels
him to evacuate Malta, Egypt, Cape of Good Hope, St.
Domingo, Guadaloup, and Martinique. In vain Addington
pleads, âPray do not insist upon Malta! I shall certainly
be turned out! and I have a great many Cousins and Uncles
and Aunts to provide for yet.â But his merciless enemy will
hear of no compromise, and yells out âAll! All! you Jean
F&mdash;t&mdash;e! and think yourself well off that I leave you
Great Britain!!!â A French officer mildly remonstrates,
and suggests, âMy General, you had better not get him
turned out, for we shall not be able to humbug them any
more.â</p>

<p>Ansell executed an engraving (February 10, 1803) of
the âRival Gardeners,â which represents Napoleon, and
George III., tending their respective gardens, which are divided
by the Channel. Napoleon has a number of plants
labelled âMilitary poppies,â which flourish well; but he is
greatly concerned about his principal flower, which has a very
drooping head and flagging leaves. He cannot understand
it. âWhy, I donât know what is the reason; my Poppies
flourish charmingly; but this <i>Corona Imperialis</i> is rather a
delicate kind of a plant, and requires great judgment in
rearing.â His rival, however, points with pride to the sturdy
British Oak, whose vigour is matchless, and is in full bloom,
with a royal crown. He replies, âNo, No, Brother Gardener,
though only a ditch parts our grounds, yet this is the spot
for true Gardening; here the <i>Corona Britanica</i> and y<sup>e</sup> <i>Heart
of Oak</i> will flourish to the end of the world.â</p>

<p>On March 8, the king sent a message to Parliament,
respecting military preparations in the ports of France and
Holland, and acquaints the House of Commons that âhe
has judged it expedient to adopt additional measures of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165">165</a></span>
precaution for the security of his dominions;â and this gives
us the key to the next <span class="locked">caricature&mdash;</span></p>

<p>âPhysical Aid, or, Britannia recoverâd from a Trance,
also the Patriotic Courage of Merry Andrew, and a peep
throâ the Fog,â was published by Gillray, March 14, 1803,
and is a very amusing picture. Bonaparte, and his flotilla,
are crossing the Channel, and Sheridan, with foolâs cap and
bell, a tattered harlequin suit, a lathen sword, âDramatic
Loyalty,â a shield with a Medusaâs head, the snaky hair of
which is labelled âEnvy, abuse, bouncing, puffing, detraction,
stolen jests, malevolence, and stale wit,â and a paper,
in his sash, endorsed âWays and means to get a living,â calls
out, âLet âem come! damâme!!! Where are the French
Buggabos? single-handed Iâd beat forty of âem!!! damâme
Iâd pay âem like Renterâs shares, sconce off their half-crowns!!!
mulct them out of their benefits, and come y<sup>e</sup>
Drury Lane Slang over âem.â</p>

<p>Britannia, suddenly aroused from her trance, screams
out, âDoctors and ministers of disgrace defend me,â and
attempts to rise. Addington is attempting to recover her,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166">166</a></span>
by holding a bottle of gunpowder to her nose, saying âDo
not be alarmâd, my dear Lady! The Buggabos (the Honest
Gentlemen, I mean) are avowedly directed to Colonial service,
they can have nothing to do Here, my lady&mdash;nothing
to do with US! do take a sniff or two to raise your Spirits,
and try to stand, if it is only upon one leg.â Lord Hawkesbury
is presenting, in a feeble manner, to Britannia, her
spear&mdash;with broken point, and her shield, which is sadly
cracked, and bleats forth, âYes, my lady, you must try to
stand up, or we shall never be able to march to Paris.â Fox,
who is wilfully screening his face with his hat, exclaims,
âDear me&mdash;what can be the reason of the old lady being
awaked in such a fright? I declare I canât see anything of
the Buggabos!â On the ground lies the treaty of peace
torn.</p>

<p>On March 13, Napoleon behaved in a very rude, and
intemperate, manner to Lord Whitworth respecting the
non-evacuation of Malta&mdash;which scene is thus <span class="locked">versified:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>âThe Political Cocksâ (by Ansell, March 27, 1803) is very
graphic. Napoleon, a game cock armed with terrific spurs,
is calling across the Channel to Pitt, who, standing on the
British Crown, is crowing lustily. Napoleon says, âEh
Master Billy, if I could but take a flight over this brook, I
would soon stop your Crowing. I would knock you off
that Perch, I swear by Mahomet, the Pope, and all the Idols
I have ever worshipped.â Pitt, however, replies, âTuck-a-roo&mdash;too&mdash;that
you never can do!!!â</p>

  <div class="caption">THE POLITICAL COCKS.</div></div>

<p>This was a fine time for the caricaturists, and their works
came thick and fast. Telling their own tale, they need no
explanation. âAn Attempt to swallow the Worldâ (artist<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169">169</a></span>
unknown, April 6, 1803) shows Napoleon attempting this
difficult feat&mdash;John Bull looking on, and remarking, âIâll
tell you what, Mr. Boneypartee, when you come to a little
spot I have in my eye, it will stick in your throat and
choak you.â</p>

<p>West (April 6, 1803) engraved âJohn Bull teased by
an Earwig.â Napoleon, drawn very small, is on John Bullâs
shoulder, pricking his cheek with his little sword. This
annoys the old man, and, looking up angrily from his meal
of bread (Ceylon), and cheese (Malta), he says, âI tell you
what, young one&mdash;if you wonât let me eat my bread and
cheese in peace and comfort, Iâll blow you away, you may
depend upon it.â To which the <i>Earwig</i> replies, âI will
have the Cheese, you Brute, you; I have a great mind to
annihilate you, you great overgrown Monster.â</p>

<p>âEasier to say than to doâ (I. Cruikshank, April 14,
1803) shows Bonaparte seated before a <i>New Map of the
World</i>, attempting to erase the British Isles. A Dutchman,
with a lighted candle, suggests, âGot for d&mdash;n de ting&mdash;here
take te candle, and burn tem out.â On the other
side, a Spaniard says, âHere, my friend, take the paste-brush,
and stick a piece of your three-coloured flag over
them.â Whilst a Jew, who has a label coming out of his
pocket, âSubscription to new loan,â says, âI tink if I lend a
little more monish at Turty per shent, it will soon annihilate
dem.â Bonaparte reflects: âI cannot scrape these little
islands out of the map. As for your plan, Mynheer, we
did try to burn them once, but they would not take fire;
and let me tell you, Don Diego, they are not so easily overrun
with any flag as you may think! I believe Mosesâs plan
the best; that, and a threat now and then may probably
do the business.â</p>

<p>âAn Attempt to undermine John Bull, or working
through the Globeâ (Roberts, April 16, 1803), shows<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170">170</a></span>
Napoleon standing on ruins, surrounded by âTerritories
pickaxed with impunityâ&mdash;Switzerland, Italian Republic,
Batavian Republic; and he is now commencing operations
with his pickaxe on John Bull, saying, âO, the Pick axe is
infinitely the best way&mdash;I shall soon be at the little fellow,
thatâs his abode, I know it by the white cliffs.â John Bull
is lying down, sword in hand, with his ear on the ground,
and says, âI hear you burrowing away, my fine fellow; but
it wonât do.&mdash;As soon as you pop your head above the
surface, you shall be saluted with a few of John Bullâs pop-guns.â</p>

<p>Another caricature (artist unknown, April 16, 1803),
called âA stoppage to a Stride over the Globe,â shows a
colossal Napoleon bestriding the World, whilst a small
John Bull, on England, is hacking at his foot, with a sword.
Napoleon, in disgust, is calling out, âAh! who is it dares to
interrupt me in my progress?â âWhy, âtis I, little Johnny
Bull, protecting a little spot I clap my hand on, and d&mdash;n
me if you come any farther&mdash;thatâs all.â</p>

<p>Ansell, too, the same date (April 16, 1803), drew âThe
Governor of Europe, Stoped in his career, or Little B&mdash;&mdash;n
too much for great B&mdash;&mdash;te.â Here a huge Bonaparte has
attempted to put his foot on Britain, and John Bull has
cut it off. Napoleon, dancing with pain and loss of blood,
drops his sword, yells out, âAh, you tam John Bull!! You
have spoil my <i>Dance</i>!! You have ruined all my Projets.â
Little John Bull, pointing to his native land, says, âI ax
pardon, Master Boney, but as we says, <i>Paws off, Pompey</i>,
we keep this little spot to ourselves, you must not dance
here Master Boney.â</p>

<p>Rowlandson (May 1, 1803), brought out âJohn Bull
listening to the quarrels of State affairs.â Napoleon is
talking to the Chancellor, and says, âAnd so&mdash;if you do <i>so</i>,
I do <i>so</i>.â The Chancellor, in an evident fright, exclaims<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171">171</a></span>
tremulously, âOh! Oh!!â whilst old John Bull looks on,
listening, all eyes and expectation, with his hair on end,
âI declare my very wig stands on end with curiosity. What
can they be quareling about? O that I could but be let
into the secret! If I ax our gentleman concerning it, it is
ten to one if he tells me the right story.â</p>

  <img src="images/i_171.jpg" width="600" height="374" alt="" /></div>

<p>On May 2, 1803, Gillray produced a very effective caricature
called âDoctor Sangrado curing John Bull of Repletion,
with the kind offices of young Clyster pipe<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">70</a> and little
Boney. A hint from Gil Blas.â John Bull is seated, very
weak indeed, held up by Lord Hawkesbury. Fox and
Sheridan are behind, bringing warm water, and everybody
in the drawing is exhorting the patient to âCourage.â
Addington is performing the operation, and the blood
streams forth copiously. Napoleon catches in his cocked
hat, Ceylon, Malta, Cape of Good Hope, and West Indies;
whilst young Clyster pipe holds out his hat, labelled âClerk
of the Pells,â and catches a stream â3,000<i>l.</i> per annum.â
This scandalous job, his father having given him this lucrative
sinecure when he was very young, excited much adverse
comment at the time.</p>

<p>âBritannia repremanding a Naughty Boy!â (artist unknown,
May 3, 1803). Britannia, with a helmet on her<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172">172</a></span>
head, her shield by her side, a spear in one hand, and a
birch rod in the other, stands on the shore at Dover. On
the top of the cliffs is a crown on a cushion. Napoleon,
attired, as usual, in an enormous cocked hat, stands on the
shore at Calais, whimpering, âIâm tired of this great hat, I
will have that crown.â But says Britannia: âStay where
you are, you little troublesome Urchin. If once you cross
the Dyke youâll get a good birchin!â</p>

<p>âLunar Speculationsâ is the whimsical title of a picture
by Ansell, May 3, 1803. Bonaparte is looking through a
large telescope, mounted on a tripod, at the moon; and he
is saying: âI wonder the Idea never struck me before!
The place would easily be taken, and has undoubtedly
great capabilities&mdash;Besides they would make me Emperor:&mdash;and
then, the sound of the Title <span class="smcap">Emperor of
the Full Moon</span>&mdash;oh! delightful! Iâll send for Garner<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">71</a>
and his balloons and set about the scheme immediately.â
John Bull, looking at him quizzically, and holding his very
fat sides, says: âWhat! going to revolutionize the Moon,
Bonny? Thatâs a good one, however&mdash;To be sure, you
talkâd of paying a visit to my little island, and one should
certainly be as easily accomplished as the other.â</p>

<p>The situation was getting more strained daily, and
Napoleon did not mend matters by his studied discourtesy
to Lord Whitworth.</p>

<p>By way of parenthesis, I may say that Napoleon made
loud complaint about the libels published about him in
England; and, to show the impartiality of the Government,
and their desire to do justice, even at a time when war
between the two countries was almost morally certain, a
Frenchman, named Jean Peltier, was prosecuted for libelling
him, the indictment being âThat peace existed between
N. Bonaparte and our Lord the King; but that M. Peltier,
intending to destroy the friendship so existing, and to despoil
said Napoleon of his consular dignity, did devise, print,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174">174</a></span>
and publish, in the French Language, to the tenor following,
&amp;c.â</p>

<p>It is never worth while to go into the words of the libel
(which appeared in a periodical called <i>LâAmbigu</i>), which
is purely political, and which would never be noticed
nowadays. I only introduce the episode to shew that the
English Government even went out of their way to conciliate
Bonaparte, and that the libel, as usual, sprang
from French sources.</p>

<p>He was unanimously found guilty, and judgment was to
have been delivered next term, but, war being renewed, he
was never called upon to appear.</p>

<p>THE <i>ULTIMATUM</i>&mdash;LORD WHITWORTH LEAVES PARIS&mdash;DECLARATION OF
WAR&mdash;CARICATURES PREVIOUS THERETO&mdash;SURRENDER OF HANOVER.</p></blockquote>

<p>Now came the <i>ultimatums</i> on both sides. The presentation
of an <i>ultimatum</i> is hardly a personal caricature of
Napoleon, but it belongs to the history of the times. One
picture was published May 3, 1803, by an unknown artist,
and was called âWaste Paper.â A French officer holds four
<i>ultimatums</i> in his hand, and presents John Bull with No. 1.
A servant, behind, carries a huge sack of <i>ultimatums</i>. The
Frenchman thus speaks: âMonsieur Jean Bull, I am come
from De Grand Nation to present you vone <i>Ultimatum</i>. If
you not like dat&mdash;I present you vone oder&mdash;I have got
seventy tree Tousand <i>Ultimatum</i>, and you must agree to
vone or de oder&mdash;or, begar, I sal kick you out of de Europe.
My lacquey has got Dem in de Sac, and will leave dem for
your consideration. Health and Fraternity, Citizen Bull!â
John Bull uplifts his cudgel, and his bulldog growls. Says
the old man, âHark ye, Mr. Frog! I was just feeling in my
pocket, for a little bit of waste paper, and you have just
supplied me in time: so now get you gone, or Iâll shew
you the use of my Horns, by tossing you out of old
<span class="smcap">England</span>.â</p>

<p>But this giving of <i>ultimatums</i> was not all on one side.
I. Cruikshank (May 14, 1803) drew âUltimatum, or the

just stepping into his carriage, and, whilst doing so, presents
Napoleon with an <i>ultimatum</i>, saying, with national courtesy,
âBe quick, or d&mdash; me Iâm off.â Napoleon is depicted
as being deeply affected by this conduct. He weeps copiously,
and wrings his hands, whimpering, âPray stop, and I
will agree to anything.â</p>

<p>There is a caricature by an artist unknown (May 18,
1803), called âThe Bone of Contention,â which is labelled
<span class="smcap">Malta</span>. Bonaparte, looking very fierce, menaces John
Bull with his sword, exclaiming âBy the Bridge of Lodi!
by the plains of Marengo!! by everything that is great and
terrible&mdash;I command you to surrender that bone!!!!â John
Bull, however, has set his foot upon that bone, and is prepared
to defend it with his oaken cudgel. He laconically
replies âYou be d&mdash;d.â</p>

<p>This subject was also treated by Ansell (June 14, 1803)
in âThe Bone of Contention, or the English Bulldog and
the Corsican Monkey.â The monkey, in a fearful and
wonderful cocked hat, calls out, âEh! you Bull Dog, vat
you carry off dat Bone for? I vas come to take dat
myself. I vas good mind to lick you, but for dem Dam
Tooths.â Whilst John Bull, typified as a bulldog, has the
bone, Malta, firmly between his teeth, and growls defiance.</p>

<p>Lord Whitworth left Paris on May 12, and arrived at
Dover on the 17th,<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">73</a> where he met General Andreossi, the
French minister, on the point of returning to France. On
the 18th, George III. sent his Declaration of War to both
Houses of Parliament, and Nelson hoisted his flag on board
the <i>Victory</i>, at Portsmouth, the same day. Thus ended a
peace which had existed only one year and sixteen days.</p>

<p>Of course, the caricatures were, necessarily, prepared a
day or two before their publication, so the dates do not depend
upon the events which took place. Such an one is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177">177</a></span>
âArmed Heroes,â Gillray, May 18, 1803, which is amusing.
It is Addington who is bestriding the Roast Beef of Old
England. Lord Hawkesbury sits behind him; whilst the
two other figures respectively represent Hely Addington
and Bragge Bathurst, who were members of the Addington
family, and had been provided with good places by their
powerful relative.</p>

<p>Napoleon looks with hungry eyes on the beef, and <span class="locked">exclaims:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Addington is in a curious state of mind, between bluster
and fear, calling out, âWhoâs afraid? damme?&mdash;<i>O Lord, O
Lord,&mdash;what a Fiery Fellow he is!</i>&mdash;Whoâs afraid? damme?&mdash;<i>O
dear! what will become of y<sup>e</sup> Roast Beef?</i> Damme!
whoâs afraid?&mdash;<i>O dear!&mdash;O dear!</i>â</p>

<p>The medicine bottles peeping out of his pockets are a
delicate allusion to Addingtonâs parentage, his father having
been a physician.</p>

<p>The caricatures which follow are simply dated May;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178">178</a></span>
but, from their internal evidence, they precede the declaration
of war. Bonaparte is represented as being excessively
frightened at the prospect of a rupture with England, and,
in May 1803, an etching (artist unknown) was produced,
shewing âA Little Man Alarmed at his own Shadow.â He
is cowering, and trembling, and looking back at his lengthened
shadow on a wall, saying âMercy on us&mdash;what tall
figure is that. It surely canât be Johnny Bull? No, no,
that cannot be, it is not lusty enough for him.â</p>

<p>A very graphic caricature is âManiac Ravings, or Little
Boney in a strong Fit. Vide Lord W&mdash;&mdash;âs<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">74</a> account of a
visit to the Thuilleries.â Here he is depicted in a fearful
state of frenzy; he has kicked over the consular chair, a
globe (with all Europe expunged, except the British Isles),
dashed his hat to the ground, upset a table, with all his
writings on it, broken his sword and scabbard; and, whilst
tearing his hair, stamps frantically on such papers as
âWyndhamâs Speeches,â âCobbettâs Weekly Journal,â Anti-Jacobin
Review,â âWilsonâs Egypt,â &amp;c. His âManiac Ravingsâ
are veritably so. âOh Egypt, Egypt, Egypt! Oh,
St. Domingo, Oh! Oh, the liberty of the English Press!
English Bloodhounds! Wyndham! Grenville! Pitt! Oh
Iâm murdered! Iâm assassinated!! London Newspapers!
Oh! Oh! Oh! Revenge! Revenge! come Fire! Sword!

English Newspapers!!!! English Newspapers!!!!!â</p>

<p>Woodward drew a picture (May 1803) of âA great Man
Intoxicated with Success,â and depicted Boney with a very
âhow came you so?â expression of countenance, reeling
along, and saying, âAh Johnny Bull, how are you my
Boy&mdash;I am going to re-establish slavery&mdash;I am grown very
Pious. I&mdash;I&mdash;Iâll double my guards. I&mdash;I&mdash;I donât know
what Iâll do.â John Bull is utterly astonished at such conduct.
âWhy, bless your heart, my fine fellow, you be
Muzzy&mdash;I dare say you find it difficult to stand. Now, let
me advise you&mdash;take a little Nap&mdash;if itâs only for a quarter
of an hour, you canât think how much it will refresh you.â</p>

<p>Another caricature, apparently by Woodward, was
published in May 1803, âBonaparte and the Quaker.â
Bonaparteâs attitude is decidedly aggressive and bullying:
âSo they are all Great Men in your Country, eh!&mdash;but I
suppose they are like you&mdash;not very fond of fighting&mdash;is
not that the case Master Quaker?â Brother Broadbrim
replies, âLittle Man, it is not the case. I myself encourage
not fighting. But if thou, or any of thy Comrades, darest
to cross the great waters, my Countrymen shall make
<i>Quakers</i> of you all.â</p>

<p>The national feeling was well expressed in a caricature
(May 1803)&mdash;Bonaparte is represented as a mighty mushroom,
looking, with no very benign expression of countenance,
on John Bull, who, embracing the British Oak, exclaims,
âYou may look as cross as you please, master Mushroom:
but here stands the British Oak, and by St. George and the
Dragon, not a leaf of it shall fall to the Ground.â</p>

<p>On May 28, George III., as Elector of Hanover,
issued a proclamation, in which he said that, abiding by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180">180</a></span>
the treaty of Luneville, he would, as Elector of Hanover,
take no part in the war. But, notwithstanding this, the
Electorate of Hanover surrendered, by capitulation, to
General Mortier on June 3. This prologue is necessary
for us to understand the following halfpenny <span class="locked">broadside:&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>
<p class="p2 center larger">A PEEP INTO HANOVER,</p>

<p class="center small">OR</p>

<p class="center"><i>A faint Description of the Atrocities committed by the French in
that City</i>.</p>

<p>It will be remembered, that the Electorate surrendered without
Resistance. This we do not mention, as increasing our Compassion
for the Inhabitants, which it certainly does not; but as
increasing our abhorrence of the Invaders, who, without Provocation,
or Pretext of Resistance, have perpetrated the Atrocities, of
which the following is a faint outline:</p>

<p>Ever since the Conquest, the whole Electorate has been a
scene of Pillage and Butchery, which is said to yield only to the
fate of Switzerland, in Spring 1798. The French Soldiers have
the most unbounded Indulgence of their ruling passions of Rapacity,
Cruelty and Lust;&mdash;<i>In the City of Hanover, and even in the
Public Street, Women of the Highest Rank have been violated by
the lowest of that brutal Soldiery, in presence of their Husbands and
Fathers, and subjected, at the same time, to such additional and
undescribable Outrages, as the brutal Fury of the Violators, enflamed
by Drunkenness, could contrive.</i> We have seen the names of some
of these unfortunate Ladies: but the Honour of their Families, and
the Peace of their own future Lives (if they can have peace) forbid
us to publish them. The Baron de K&mdash;&mdash;, a well known partisan
of French Philosophy and Politics, went to the Commandant of
Hanover, and claimed his Protection, as an admirer of the French
Revolution! but he found no more favour in the Sight of the
<i>Aga of Sultan</i> <span class="smcap">Bonaparteâs</span> Janisaries, than the most loyal
<i>Noblemen in Hanover</i>. The French Officer told him, â<i>All that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181">181</a></span>
Jacobinism is now out of Fashion&mdash;Go about your business!</i>â Nor
have we heard that the Philosophers of Gottingen, the Enthusiasts
of <i>Equality and Perfectability</i>, have been at all better
<span class="locked">treated.&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Such are the tender Mercies of the Wicked! Such are the
Gangs of ferocious Banditti, whom the <span class="smcap">Murderer of Jaffa</span> let
loose on the civilized World! Such, and ten thousand times
worse, is the Fate prepared <i>for England, if the valour of her people
do not avert it; for England will assuredly be more oppressed, in
proportion as she is more dreaded, envied, and hated</i>. To shew any
symptom of Neutrality in such a Cause, not to support it with all
our might, <span class="smcap">is the foulest Treason against the People of
England</span>; and the poorest honest Labourer, who has a Mother,
or a Sister, a Wife, or a Daughter, has, in truth, as much reason
as the highest Duke in the Land to detest the Traitor. Englishmen
think of this and profit by Example.</p></blockquote>

<p>These were the kind of handbills (of which there are
hundreds in variety) which were circulated, to arouse and
stimulate martial fire and patriotic ardour in the Britannic
mind. Their name is Legion, and I have had to read
them all, in order to pick out the examples given in this
book. They are curious, and help us, more than any other
history, to gauge the temper of the times. It was a veritable
scare. Hardly having felt any of the benefits of
peace, the English were once more involved in war, with
the almost certainty, this time, of having their, hitherto
almost inviolate, islands invaded by the French. We can
hardly wonder, therefore, at the hearty hatred our forefathers
felt for the âCorsican Ogre,â to whom all this turmoil
was due; and, to do them justice, they did hate him
with a thoroughly genuine detestation&mdash;so much so, that
they did not always scrupulously investigate the truth of
some of the very questionable statements dished up for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182">182</a></span>
them (and they were highly spiced). There can be no
manner of doubt but that these broadsides and handbills,
together with the caricatures, had the desired effect in
rousing the nation to a fervid patriotism, and, as they did
so, it is perhaps hardly right to question the legality of
their statements, but accept them according to the doctrine
that âthe end justifies the means.â</p>

<p>PATRIOTIC HANDBILLS.</p></blockquote>

<p>On June 10, 1803, Gillray published an extra-sized picture
of âFrench Invasion&mdash;or Buonaparte Landing in Great
Britain.â The French fleet is nearing land, and boats, full
of armed men, are putting off. Bonaparte, and a large
body of troops, including cavalry, have landed; but, before
they can scale the cliffs, and are yet on the shore, a few
artillerymen, with two guns, have utterly routed them. It
is <i>Sauve qui peut</i>. Napoleon, joining in the flight, throws
away his sword; the army is utterly demoralised, the ground
being strewn with dead.</p>

<p>I. Cruikshank drew a not very interesting caricature,
(June 10, 1803) of âThe Scarecrowâs arrival, or Honest <span class="smcap">Pat</span>
giving them an Irish Welcome.â Napoleon, as a skeleton,
is leading an army of skeletons, who are wading through
the sea. He is just putting his foot on the shore, and, to
encourage his troops, calls out, âNow, my boys, halloo away&mdash;vil
frighten Mr. Bull out of his wits, we vil make them quake
like the Dutch, the Italian, the Swiss, and the rest of our
Friends.â But a sturdy Irishman receives them with a shovelfull
of mud in their faces. âOch it is your own pratty figure
it is, Master Bonny, dâye think that Pat was to be blarneyâd
by such Scare Crows. No, no, Bother, the time is gone by:
Patâs Eyes are wide open, and, look ye, if you donât immediately
jump into the Sea to save your lives, I will shovel
you all there to save mine.â</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184">184</a></span>
Here is a stirring appeal to the <span class="locked">army:&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">BRAVE SOLDIERS.</p>

<p class="p1 center b1"><i>Defenders of your</i> <span class="smcap">Country</span>.</p>

<p>The road to glory is open before you.&mdash;Pursue the great career
of your forefathers, and rival them in the field of honour. <i>A
proud and usurping</i> <span class="smcap">Tyrant</span> (a name ever execrated by Englishmen)
dares to <i>threaten our shores with</i> <span class="smcap">Invasion</span>, <i>and to reduce
the free born Sons of Britain to</i> <span class="smcap">Slavery</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Servitude</span>. Forgetting
what English Soldiers are capable of, and ranking them
with the hirelings of the powers who have fallen his prey on the
Continent, he supposes his threat easily executed. <i>Give him a
lesson, my brave Countrymen, that he will not easily forget, and
that France may have by heart, for a Century to come!</i> Neither
the vaunting Hero (who deserted his own Comrades and Soldiers
in Egypt), nor the French Army, have ever been able to cope
with British valour when fairly opposed to it. Our Ancestors
declared that <span class="smcap">One Englishman</span> <i>was ever a match for</i> <span class="smcap">Three
Frenchmen</span>&mdash;and that man to man was too great odds in our
favour. We have but to feel their sentiments, to confirm them&mdash;you
will find that their declaration was founded on experience;
and that even in our day, within these three years, an army of
your brave Comrades has convinced its admiring Country, that
the balance is still as great as ever, against the enemy. Our
<span class="smcap">Edward</span>, <i>the illustrious Black Prince, laid waste the country of
France, to the Gates of Paris, and, on the Plains of Cressy, left 11
Princes and 30,000 men dead upon the Field of Battle&mdash;a greater
number than the whole English Army boasted at the beginning of
the action</i>. The same heroic Prince, having annihilated the Fleet
of France, <i>entirely routed her Army at Poictiers, took her King
prisoner, and brought him Captive to London, with thousands of
his Nobles and People, and all this against an Army</i> <span class="smcap">six times as
numerous as that of the English</span>! Did not our Harry the
Fifth invade France, and at Agincourt <i>oppose an Army of 9,000
men, sickly, fatigued, and half starved, to that of the French,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185">185</a></span>
amounting to 50,000</i>; and did he not leave 10,000 of the enemy
dead upon the field, and take 14,000 prisoners, with the loss of
only 400 men?</p>

<p>Have we not, within this century, to boast a <span class="smcap">Marlborough</span>,
who, (besides his other victories) at Blenheim slew 12,000 of the
French, and made 14,000 Prisoners, <i>and in less than a month
conquered 300 miles of Territory from the Enemy</i>? Did not
the gallant <span class="smcap">Wolfe</span>, in the year 1759, gain the Heights of Abraham
with a handful of British Troops, and, afterwards, <i>defeat the
whole French Army, and gain possession of all Canada, &amp;c.</i>?</p>

<p>And are not the glories of our <span class="smcap">Abercromby</span> <i>and the Gallant</i>
<span class="smcap">Army</span> <i>of</i> <span class="smcap">Egypt</span> fresh in your minds? <i>An Army of 14,000
Britons, who landed in the face of upwards of 20,000 troops of
France</i>, and drove from a country, with whose strongholds they
were acquainted, and whose resources they knew how to apply, a
host of Frenchmen, enured to the Climate, and Veterans in arms?
<i>Did they not cut in pieces that vaunted Corps of Buonaparteâs,
whose successes against other Powers had obtained for it the appellation
of</i> <span class="smcap">Invincible</span>&mdash;And is not their Standard (all that is left of
it) a trophy, at this moment, in our Capital?</p>

<p><i>The Briton fights for his Liberty and Rights</i>, the Frenchman
fights for <i>Buonaparte</i>, who has robbed him of both! Which,
then, in the nature of events, will be most zealous, most active,
and most terrible in the Field of Battle? the independent supporter
of his countryâs cause, or the Slave who trembles lest the
arms of his comrades should be turned against himself; who
knows that his Leader, his General, his <i>Tyrant</i>, <i>did not hesitate,
after having</i> <span class="smcap">Murdered</span> <i>4,000 disarmed Turks, in cool blood, to</i>
<span class="smcap">Poison</span> <i>300 of his own sick Soldiers, of men who had been fighting
his battles of ambition, and been wounded in his defence</i>&mdash;English
Soldiers will scarcely credit this, but it is on record, not to be
doubted, never to be expunged. But more; read and blush for
the depravity even of an enemy. It is not that these bloody deeds
have been perpetrated from necessity, from circumstances however
imperious at the moment; they were the acts of cool and
deliberate determination, and his purpose, no less sanguinary, is
again declared in the event of success in his enterprise against<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186">186</a></span>
this Country. Feeling that even the slavish followers of his fortune
were not to be forced to embark in this ruinous and destructive
expedition, he declares to them, in a public proclamation, or
decoy, that <i>when they have landed in this Country, in order to
make the booty the richer</i>, <span class="smcap">No Quarter</span> <i>shall be given to the</i> <span class="smcap">Base
English</span> <i>who fight for their perfidious Government&mdash;that they shall
be</i> <span class="smcap">Put to the Sword</span>, <i>and their Property distributed among the
Soldiers of the Victorious Army</i>!!! Say, is this the conduct of a
Hero? is this the man who is destined to break the spirit of
Englishmen? <i>shall we suffer an</i> <span class="smcap">Assassin</span> <i>to enter our blessed
Country, and despoil our fields of their produce&mdash;to massacre our
brave Soldiers in cool blood, and hang up every man who has carried
arms?</i> Your cry is vengeance for the insult&mdash;and Vengeance is
in your own hands. It must be signal and terrible! Like the bolt
from Heaven, let it strike the devoted Army of Invaders! <i>Every
Frenchman will find his Grave where he first steps on British
ground, and not a Soldier of Buonaparteâs boasted Legions shall
escape the fate his ambitious Tyrant has prepared for him!</i></p>

<p class="center">BRITONS STRIKE HOME!</p>

<p class="center">Or your Fame is for ever blasted,&mdash;Your Liberties for ever lost!!!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is very bombastic and âhigh-falutin,â but Englishmen
were in a very grievous fright, nevertheless.</p>

<p>Still harping on the prospect of a French landing, we
have a caricature by T. West (June 13, 1803) of âBritannia
correcting an Unruly Boy.â Britannia has got Boney
across her knee, and, having taken down his breeches, is administering
such a sound castigation with a birch rod, called
the <i>United Kingdom</i>, as to bring forth copious streams of
blood. Needless to say, our hero is repentant, and prays
âOh forgive me this time and I never will do so again. Oh
dear! Oh dear! youâll entirely destroy the <i>Honors of the
Sitting</i>.â But the stern matron still keeps on, with âThere
take that, and that, and that, and be more careful not to
provoke my anger more.â</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187">187</a></span>
We have an illustration of the homely proverb of âSet
a beggar on horseback &amp;c.,â in âThe Corsican Beggar
Riding to the Devil,â by Ansell (June 15, 1803). Here we
have Hell treated in the mediÃ¦val manner, a huge, grotesque,
dragon-like head, with outstretched jaws, vomiting
flames. Napoleon, on a white charger, hugging himself
with the idea that âSure they will make me Emperor,â is
riding straight to it; whilst two devils are in a high state
of jubilation.â One opines that âHe is sure to come; we
will finish your ambition,â the other politely calls out, âShew
him in.â Ireland asks John Bull, âHey Johnny, whoâs that?â
and gets as a reply, âTis Boney going Post, brother Pat.â
The Gallic Cock, crowing on its dunghill, screams, âThis is
nothing new.â</p>

<p>Here is a passionate appeal, supposed to come from one
of the softer <span class="locked">sex:&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p class="center larger">MEN OF ENGLAND.</p>

<p>It is said that some of you are so discontented, that you would
join the Enemies against your Country&mdash;Is it possible that you
are so misled as to believe that the Enemies to England would,
whatever they pretend, be friends <i>to you</i>. Be assured, if you are
so persuaded, that you are grossly imposed upon. What should
make them your friends&mdash;What ties should bind them? Think a
little&mdash;and a very little proper reflection will be sufficient to make
you see, that the Invaders of your Country, in their hearts, hate
the inhabitants of it; and will, in the end, themselves betray the
Traitors to it.</p>

<p>The Invaders would nearly desolate your Country&mdash;and if
Provisions are dear now, what would they be when numberless
stacks of hay and corn were burnt&mdash;the cattle destroyed, and a
horrid legion of desperate, faithless, lawless Invaders, to be maintained?
who would trample upon every tie, break all promises,
make <i>tools</i> of you first, but soon sacrifice your wives, your daughters,
your families, and yourselves, when you have served their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188">188</a></span>
purpose. If any few among you were guilty of plunder, you
would, yourselves, soon be plundered and destroyed.</p>

<p>It has been the necessity of defending our country against its
enemies that has made provisions dear; but your wages have
been increased in proportion&mdash;and though you may sometimes,
in the course of events, suffer some hardships, as <i>everybody</i>, in
their turn, must do, you may, unless it be your own faults, enjoy
the greatest comforts&mdash;a peaceable home&mdash;a happy family&mdash;a
quiet country, whose trade and consequence is envied by all the
world&mdash;plentiful harvests&mdash;a government which respects you, and
that your forefathers would have defended with the last drop of
their blood&mdash;you have an excellent and lawful King, who will
protect you; and above all, you may have a blessing from God,
who will reward you hereafter if you do your duty <i>here</i>. But from
an Usurper, and Invader, you can have nothing to expect, but the
being slaves to his lawless schemes for power. Let who will tell
you the contrary, he comes only for plunder, and revenge, upon
the only nation he fears. Will you be his instruments, his tools?
Can you, as Englishmen, lower yourselves in such a manner&mdash;to
such a mean Usurper? Heaven, from the beginning, intended
you should have Kings and superiors&mdash;Equality was never intended&mdash;it
never can be, on this earth&mdash;Heaven and reason forbid
it&mdash;and Bonaparte, himself, has shewn you how little he intended
to establish it. Your forefathers call to you from their graves&mdash;their
warning voice tells you, that you would soon find the perfidy
of his heart. The wretched condition you would bring yourselves
and your families into, you would repent too late&mdash;deprived of
every friend, but sure of ample punishment here, and hereafter.</p>

<p>People of England! Sons of my beloved glorious Country!
You are now called upon by the women of your Country to
protect them&mdash;Can you refuse to hear us? Can you bear the
thought of not only seeing <i>us</i> used with insult and barbarity,&mdash;of
seeing your country bleed at every pore, but of being the occasion
of these dreadful evils, in consequence of your mistaken opinions,
and by suffering yourselves to be deceived, and cajoled, by
foreign, ill designing wretches, who have only our, and your, ruin

<p>It is a weak spot in these lucubrations that very few of
them are dated, so that it is impossible to arrange them,
like the illustrations, in chronological sequence. But this is
of little matter; the situation was the same, whatever might
be the month.</p>

<p>J. Smith (June 25, 1803) etched King George âPlaying
at Bubbles.â The monarch is seated before a large tub of
soap-suds, amusing himself by blowing bubbles, which are
<i>Napoleon, flat-bottomed boats, invasion, and little ships</i>&mdash;and,
judging by the kingâs placid countenance, caring very little
for his creations.</p>

<p>A very excellent example of caricature is Gillrayâs
âKing of Brobdingnag and Gulliverâ (June 26, 1803). The
burly king has the diminutive Bonaparte in the palm of
his hand and is critically examining him through his glass.
Says he, âMy little friend Grildrig you have made a most
admirable panegyric upon yourself and country, but from
what I can gather from your own relation, and the answers<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190">190</a></span>
I have with much pains wringâd and extorted from you, I
cannot but conclude you to be one of the most pernicious
little odious reptiles that nature ever suffered to crawl upon
the surface of the Earth.â</p>

<p>And, indeed, he well deserved this character, if he were
anything like the demon the English sought to make him
out. In one of the handbills, however, is a quotation from
âDenonâs Travels in Egypt,â which is wrested to serve its
purpose in fomenting the Invasion furor.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>To the infamous <span class="smcap">Wretch</span>, if there be such an one in England,
who dares to talk of, or even hopes to find <i>Mercy</i> in the Breast of
the <i>Corsican Bonaparte</i>, the <i>eternal sworn Foe of England</i>, the
Conqueror and Grand Subjugator of France.</p>

<p>If there be any Englishmen so base, or so foolish, as to wish
to trust to the <i>Mercy</i> of a French <i>Invading Army</i>, let him read
that which follows:&mdash;The accuracy and veracity of the account
cannot be doubted, it being an Extract from a Book, not only
written under the inspection of the French Government, but,
moreover, dedicated to the <i>Grand Consul</i>.</p>

<p>I shall make no comment on this most scandalous public
avowal, or rather, boast, of so inhuman and atrocious a proceeding,
as the simple Fact sufficiently speaks for itself.</p>

<p>âWe, who boasted that we were more just than the Mamelukes,
committed daily, and <i>almost necessarily</i>, a number of iniquities:
the difficulty of distinguishing our Enemies by their Form
and Colour, made us, every day, <i>kill innocent Peasants</i>; the
Soldiers took Caravans of <i>poor Merchants</i> for enemies, and, before
justice could be done them, (<i>when there was time to do it</i>) <i>two or
three of them were shot</i>, a part of their cargo was <i>pillaged or destroyed</i>,
and their camels exchanged for those of ours, which had
been wounded. The Fate of the People, <i>for whose happiness we
no doubt came to Egypt</i>, was no better. If, at our approach, terror
made them leave their houses, they found on their return, nothing
but <i>the Mud of which the Walls were composed</i>; utensils, ploughs,
gates, roofs, everything served as fuel to boil our Soup; their pots<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191">191</a></span>
were broken, their grain was eaten, their fowls and pigeons
roasted, and nothing was left but the carcases of their dogs, <i>when
they defended the Property of their Masters</i>. If we remained in
their Villages, the wretches were <i>summoned to return</i>, under pain
of being treated as <i>Rebels</i>, and, in consequence, <i>double Taxed</i>;
and when they yielded to these Menaces, came <i>to pay their Tax</i>,
it sometimes happened, that, from their great number, they were
taken for a body of Revolters, their sticks for arms, and they
received <i>some discharges of Musketry before there was time for
explaining the Mistake</i>; the Dead were interred, and we remained
friends, till a safe opportunity for revenge occurred. It is true,
that when they staid at home, <i>paid the Tax, and supplied all the
Wants of the Army</i>, they were saved the trouble of a Journey to a
Residence in the Desert, <i>saw their Provisions consumed with
regularity</i>, and <i>were allowed</i> a Part of them, preserved some of
their gates, sold their eggs to the Soldiers, <span class="smcap">and had but few of
their Wives and Daughters Violated</span>!â</p>

<p>Such was the Treatment which Egypt experienced; a Country
which the French were desirous to possess, and to conciliate;
very Different is their Design upon Great Britain, which it is their
avowed Intention to Ravage, Plunder and Destroy.</p></blockquote>

<p>ATTEMPT AT MEDIATION BY RUSSIA&mdash;MARTIAL ENTHUSIASM IN ENGLAND&mdash;ENROLMENT
OF VOLUNTEERS&mdash;PATRIOTIC HANDBILLS AND SONGS.</p></blockquote>

<p>Ineffectual attempts at mediation seem to have been
made, but, situated as the two opposing Powers were, this
could not be.</p>

<p>âBruin become mediatorâ (artist unknown, June 1803)
represents the Emperor of Russia as a bear, joining the
hands of a Bull and a Monkey. The peacemaker thus
addresses them, âI wonder you civilized folks could not
agree upon matters without reference to me, whom you
have ridiculed as a Barbarian&mdash;but I suppose you think I
must have more sense than yourselves, because I come
further North.â The Monkey is giving his hand with âI
promise on the faith of a Frenchman (which is as any Birmingham
Sixpence) to let you graze quietly in the Malta
Paddock&mdash;and to love you with all my heart, as much as I
do the Liberty of the French Nation.â The Bull says,
âWell Nappy, if you will leave off your Pranks and not
think of skipping over to Egypt, and if you will promise
not to hop the twig to Hanover, I will be reconciled.â</p>

<p>And again, a month later, is another caricature, called
âOlympic Games, or John Bull introducing his new
Ambassador to the Grand Consul,â by I. Cruikshank (July
16, 1803), shewing us the little Corsican giving an ambassador
a blow in the face with his clenched fist, saying, âThere<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193">193</a></span>
Sir, take that, and tell your master, Iâll thrash every one
who dares to speak to me: Iâll thrash all the World. D&mdash; me
Iâll, Iâll, Iâll, be King of the Universe.â The astonished
Ambassador exclaims, âWhy this is Club Law! this is the
Argument of force indeed. The little Gentleman is DerangÃ©.â
John Bull, however, is introducing a prize-fighter
as his representative, telling Napoleon, âThere, my Boy, is
an Ambassador who will treat with you in your own way&mdash;but
I say, be as gentle with him as you can.â The pugilist
looks on his adversary with contempt, âWhat! is it that
little whipper snapper I am to set to with? Why I think
the <i>first round</i> will settle his hash.â The Austrian ambassador
meanwhile remarks, âThe Monarch I represent, will
return this insult with becoming Dignity.â</p>

<p>Martial enthusiasm was at its height, corps of volunteers
were enrolled everywhere. The militia, 80,000 strong,
had been called out on March 25; there was the regular
army of 130,000, and, on June 28, the House of Commons
agreed to the raising of 50,000 more, by means of conscription&mdash;of
which England was to furnish 34,000, Ireland
10,000, and Scotland 6,000; whilst, on June 30, the Court
of Common Council for the City of London resolved to
raise, and equip, 800 men for the national service. This,
be it remembered, only represented that portion of London
within the city walls. Factions were for a time done
away with, and men, of all shades of politics, stood shoulder
by shoulder, as now, in the ranks of the different volunteer
corps. Stirring broadsides were not needed, although they
appeared, and the following may be taken as a good
<span class="locked">sample:&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194">194</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p class="center larger">ENGLISH MASTIFFS.</p>

<p>We by this Address, publicly and solemnly, before God and our
Country, pledge our Fortunes, Persons, and Lives, in the Defence
of our Sovereign, and all the Blessings of our glorious Constitution.</p>

<p>There is not a Man that hears me, I am persuaded, who is
not prompt and eager to redeem that pledge. There is not, there
cannot be a Man here, who would leave undefended, our good,
tried, and brave <span class="smcap">Old King</span> in the Hour of Danger.</p>

<p>No, Sir! we need now no Warning-voice; no string of Eloquence;
no Thoughts that heat, and Words that burn, are necessary
to raise a Host of hardy Men, when the King, the Parliament,
and the Country are in Distress.<a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">75</a> <span class="smcap">Call out to Yorkshiremen</span>,
â<span class="smcap">Come forth to battle!</span>â our Answer will be&mdash;One and All&mdash;â<span class="smcap">We
are ready!</span>&mdash;<i>There is the Enemy!</i>&mdash;Lead on!â Sir, that
Enemy is not far off; a very numerous, well appointed, ably
commanded Army, to whom is promised the Plunder of England,
are now hovering round, and Part of them in daily Sight of the
Promised Land. They view it, like so many famished Wolves,
Cruel as Death, and Hungry as the Grave, panting for an Opportunity,
at any Risk, to come into our Sheep Fold;&mdash;<i>but</i>, and if
they should, is it not our Business, our first Duty, to have such a
Guard of old, faithful <span class="smcap">English Mastiffs</span>, of the old Breed, as
shall make them quickly repent their temerity.</p>

<p>The Chief Consul of France tells us, that we are but a Nation
of Shopkeepers: let us, Shopkeepers, then melt our Weights, and
our Scales, and return him the Compliment in Bullets. Sir; we
may have a firm Reliance on the Exertions of as gallant a Fleet
as ever sailed; but the Fleet cannot perform Impossibilities; it
cannot be in two places at once; it cannot conquer the Winds, and
subdue the Storms. Though our old Tars can do much, they
cannot do everything; and it would be unsafe and dastardly to lie<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195">195</a></span>
skulking behind them. With the Blessing of <span class="smcap">God</span>, and a good
Cause, we can do Wonders; but if we depend upon our Naval
Prowess only, we have much to fear. NO, <span class="smcap">Sir</span>: England will
never be perfectly safe, until she can defend herself as well by
<i>Land</i>, as by <i>Sea</i>; until she can defy the haughty Foe: if there
was <i>even a Bridge</i> between Calais and Dover, and that Bridge in
Possession of the Enemy, still can she say, in the Language of a
good <i>English Boxing Match</i>, â<span class="smcap">A fair Field and no Favour</span>.â</p></blockquote>

<p>âOur good, tried, and brave <span class="smcap">Old King</span>, in the Hour of
Danger,â had made all snug, at least as far as human foresight
could act. When the dreaded invasion came, he was
to go either to Chelmsford or Dartford; whilst the Queen,
with the Royal Family and the treasure, were to go to
Worcester, the city whose motto is âCivitas in bello, et in
pace, fidelis.â All the stores at Woolwich, including the
artillery, were to be sent into the Midlands by means of
the Grand Junction Canal; in fact, every precaution was
taken that forethought could devise: and there is but little
doubt that, had Napoleon made good a landing, he would
have had a warmer reception than he expected. Yet what
disadvantages they laboured under compared to our days!
no Telegraphs, no Railways, no Steam. Of course it may
be said that the enemy was in no better position; but still
a lucky wind might favour their crossing, and hinder our
preventing it.</p>

<p>âThe Final Pacification of Europeâ (artist unknown,
June 1803) shews that this desirable thing could only be
accomplished by the death of Napoleon&mdash;so he is represented
as being suspended from a gallows, whilst postboys,
duly equipped with horns, and dressed in their different
national garbs, are shouting, âGood News for Russia, Prussia,
Old England, Germany, and Switzerland.â Holland is excessively
joyful: Mynheer calling out, âGood news for

<p>A very amusing caricature is âGreen Spectacles, or
Consular Gogglesâ (artist unknown, June 1803), where
Napoleon is represented as sitting on a rock called <i>Usurped
Power</i>, and wearing an enormous pair of green goggles
labelled âGreen eyed Jealousy,â through which he darts
envious glances at Great Britain, West Indies, East Indies,
Malta, and Egypt.</p>

<p>We meet with a slight notice of Toussaint lâOuverture, and
the war in St. Domingo, in a broadside dwelling on the
consequences of a successful invasion: âHere then there
would be no <i>volunteering</i>, no <i>balloting</i>, unless, indeed, such
Volunteers as were raised in France for the conquest of St.
Domingo. And how were they raised? Why, by every
man having a bayonet put to his breast, being seized by
force, and then <i>chained in couples like dogs</i>, and drove down
in a string to the coast, for embarkation, like so many
<i>Galley slaves</i>. This, though it may sound incredible to an
Englishmanâs ear, is a fact known to all Europe.</p>

<p>âSuch my brave Countrymen, would be your dreadful

According to the caricaturist, Hanover had no special
attractions for Bonaparte. âBoney in possession of the
Millstoneâ (Ansell, July 5, 1803) shews him as having a
fearfully large and weighty millstone hung round his neck,
called Hanover. He totters under the weight, and calls
out that âItâs cursed heavy! I wish it had been Malta!â
John Bull, dressed as a countryman, jeers him: âWhat!
thee hast got it, hast thee? The Devil do thee good with
it&mdash;Old Measter Chatham used to say it was a Millstone
about my neck&mdash;so perhaps I may feel more lightsome
without it.â</p>

<p>âFlags of Truth and Liesâ (artist unknown, July 10,
1803) is a representation of a typical Frenchman and
Englishman, as then imagined. The Frenchman holds a
tricoloured flag, and intimates that âMon grande MaÃ®tre
bid-a you read dat, Monsieur!â and points to the following
text on the flag: âCitizen first Consul Buonaparte presents
Compliments and Thanks to the Ladies and Gentlemen of
Great Britain, who have honored him with their visits at
Paris, and intends himself the pleasure of returning it in
person, as soon as his arrangements for that purpose can be
completed.â John Bull replies, âAnd let your Grand Master
read that, Mounseer,â and points to his flag, the Union
Jack, on which is written âJohn Bull does not rightly understand
the Chief Consulâs lingo&mdash;but supposes he means
something about Invasion; therefore the said John Bull
deems it necessary to observe that if his Consular Highness
dares to invade any Ladies or Gentlemen on his coast, heâll
be damnâd if he donât sink him.â</p>

<blockquote>

<p>And when the great man came from Egypt, he used cunning,
and force, to subject the people. The good, as well as the wicked,
of the land trembled before him, because he had won the hearts
of all the fighting men; and, after he had succeeded in many of
his schemes, his heart swelled with pride, and he sought how to
ensnare the people more and more, to be the greatest man under
the Sun.</p>

<p>The Multitude of the people were of four kinds; some resembled
blind men, that cannot see; some were fearful, who trembled
before him; others courageous, and for the good of the people,
but too weak in number; and others yet, who were as wicked as
the great man himself. And when he was at the head of the
deluded nation, he gave strict laws, and the following commandments,
which were read before a multitude of people, and in a full
congregation of all his priests:</p>

<p>1. Ye Frenchmen, ye shall have no other commander above
me, for I, Bonaparte, am the supreme head of the nation, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206">206</a></span>
will make all nations bow down to you, and obey me, as your
Lord, and Commander.</p>

<p>2. Ye shall not have any graven images upon your coin, in
marble, wood, or metal, which might represent any person above
me; nor shall ye acknowledge any person to excel me, whether
he be among the living or the dead; whether he be in the happy
land of the enlightened French, or in the cursed island of the
dull English; for I, the Chief Consul of France, am a jealous
hero, and visit disobedience of an individual upon a whole nation,
and of a father upon the children, and upon the third and fourth
generation of them that hate me; and shew mercy unto those that
love me, and humble themselves.</p>

<p>3. Ye shall not trifle with my name, nor take it in vain; nor
shall you suffer that any other nation treat it disrespectfully, for
I will be the sole commander upon earth, and make you triumph
over your enemies.</p>

<p>4. Remember, that ye keep the days of prayers, and pray for
me as the head of the Nation and the future Conqueror of the
base English. Ye shall pray fervently, with your faces cast upon
the ground, and not look at the priest when he pronounces my
name; for I am a jealous hero, and delight in my priests, because
they are humble, and I have regarded the lowliness of their
hearts, and forgiven them all their past iniquities. And ye priests,
remember the power of him, who made you his creatures, and do
your duty.</p>

<p>5. Respect and honour all French heroes, that ye may find
mercy in mine eyes for all your iniquities, and that ye may live in
the land, in which I, the Lord, your Commander, live.</p>

<p>6. Ye shall not murder each other, save it be by my own commands,
for purposes that may be known to me alone; but of your
enemies, and all those nations that will not acknowledge your,
and my, greatness, ye may kill an infinite number; for that is a
pleasing sight in the eyes of your supreme commander.</p>

<p>7. Ye shall not commit adultery at home, whatever ye may do
in the land of infidels, and the stiff-necked people; for they are
an abomination to the Lord, your Commander.</p>

<p>8. Ye shall not steal at home, but suppress your covetousness,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207">207</a></span>
and insatiable desire of plunder, until ye may arrive in the land of
our enemies. Ye shall neither steal from them with indiscretion,
but seem to give with the left hand, when the right taketh.</p>

<p>9. Ye shall not bear false witness against your neighbour, if he
should distinguish himself in the land of the enemies.</p>

<p>10. Ye shall not covet any thing of your neighbour, but everything
of your enemies; his jewels, his gold, his silver, his horse or
ass, his maid, his daughter, his wife, or anything in which your
hearts find delight; and ye may take it, but still with cunning;
for the Lord, your Commander, loveth mildness, more than
strength, to please the people when he plunders.&mdash;Use the sword
in battle, cunning after it, look for plunder, but subject the people
to me;&mdash;herein lie all my commandments, and those who keep
them shall be protected by my power and prosper in all my undertakings.</p></blockquote>

Bonaparte is in a retort, being distilled, and George the

<p>INVASION, <i>continued</i>,&mdash;âBRITONS, STRIKE HOMEâ&mdash;BONAPARTEâS WILL.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>At this time much use was made of the phrase âBritons,
strike home!â which first appears in an adaptation of Beaumont
and Fletcherâs play of âBonduca,â or Boadicea&mdash;which
was set to music by Henry Purcell in 1695. The few words
are not in the original drama, but are interpolated with
other songs, and form a solo and chorus.</p>

<p>There is an amusing picture by West (July 1803) called
Amusement after Dinner, or The Corsican Fairy displaying<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216">216</a></span>
his Prowess.â George the Third and Queen Charlotte
are at dessert, which is, as was their whole <i>mÃ©nage</i>, frugal,
consisting only of a blancmange&mdash;the top ornament of
which is a fleet of ships, behind which is a pineapple (the
<i>King fruit</i>, as it was called on its introduction into England),
the summit of which bears a crown. The royal pair are
highly amused by the antics of the Corsican fairy (Napoleon)
who vapours about the table in huge cocked hat and enormous
sword. Pointing to the blancmange, he says, âIf I
could but get over this dish of Blanche Mange, I would
soon invade the Pine Apple.â</p>

<p>In âA Monstrous Stride,â by I. Cruikshank (July 25,
1803), Bonaparte is represented as flourishing his sword
and, having one foot on Turkey and Poland, is attempting
to put the other on Great Britain, but steps short, and
comes among the fleet guarding the English shores.
Underneath the picture is âHe will put his foot in it.â</p>

<p>There was a somewhat amusing political squib on
Napoleon, published some time in July of this year, entitled</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="center larger">BONAPARTEâS WILL.</p>

body, the fear of recoiling daggers, the dreadful anticipation of
infernal machines emitting fire and smoke, invented at Jaffa, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217">217</a></span>
the hissing breath of the poisonous serpents generated at El
Arish, remind us that we soon must die, and that our power must
die with us. We, therefore, according to the <i>Senatus Consultum</i>
of our free Senate, do declare this to be our last Will and Testament,
as follows:</p>

<p class="center"><i>Imprimis.</i></p>

<p>We command, and desire most earnestly, not to be buried in
any Church or Church-yard, in any mosque or pantheon, but in

high priest to the <i>Goddess</i> of <i>Reason</i>, <i>Mercier</i>, the atheist of
the Institute, <i>Amarat</i>, the mufti of <i>Constantinople</i>, and <i>Pius</i> the

administrators, and assigns, we give and bequeath our everlasting
hate; and it is our further will and pleasure, that, if any potentate
or power, shall harbour the said <i>Louis</i> XVIII. or any of the said
princes, such harbouring shall be a good cause of war; and the
potentate and power guilty of such humanity, and hospitality,
shall be punished by a Coalition of Powers as a violater of the law
of nations, and contrary to the rights of man.</p>

<p>In Witness whereof, we have hereunto set our hand and seal
the 25th day of Prairial, (14 June, 1803) in the eleventh year of
the French Republic, one and indivisible.</p>

<p>A most ghastly picture, which should not be called a
caricature, yet is meant so to be, is by Gillray (July 26,
1803), and is called âBuonaparte forty-eight Hours after
Landing!â A crowd of rural volunteers are assembled,
and one of them hoists the head of Napoleon upon a pitchfork,
calling out âHa, my little Boney! what doâst think of
Johnny Bull, now? Plunder Old England! hay? make
French slaves of us all! hay? ravish all our Wives and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223">223</a></span>
Daughters! hay? O Lord, help that silly Head! To
think that Johnny Bull would ever suffer those lanthorn
Jaws to become King of Old England Roast Beef and
Plum pudding.â Whilst on the top of the engraving is
inscribed, âThis is to give information for the benefit of all
Jacobin Adventurers, that Policies are now openâd at
Lloydâs&mdash;where the depositer of One Guinea is entitled to
a Hundred if the Corsican Cut throat is alive 48 Hours after
Landing on the British Coast.â</p>

<p>Ansell also takes up this gruesome subject (August 6,
1803) in âAfter the Invasion. The LevÃ©e en Masse, or Britons
Strike Home.â The French have landed, but have been
thoroughly defeated; the British soldiers driving them bodily
over the cliffs, into the sea. The women are plundering
the dead, but complain bitterly of the poverty of their spoil.
âWhy, this is poor finding, I have emptied the pockets of
a score and only found garlic, one head of an onion, and a
parcel of pill boxes.â A rural volunteer, who has Bonaparteâs
head on a pitchfork, addresses two comrades thus:
âHere he is exalted, my Lads, 24 Hours after Landing.â
Says one of the countrymen, âWhy, Harkee, dâye zee, I
never liked soldiering afore, but, somehow or other, when
I thought of our Sal, the bearns, the poor Cows, and the
Geese, why I could have killed the whole Army, my own
self.â The other remarks, âDang my Buttons if that beant
the head of that Rogue Boney&mdash;I told our Squire this
morning, What do you think, says I, the lads of our Village
canât cut up a Regiment of them French Mounseers?
and, as soon as the Lasses had given us a Kiss for good
luck, I could have sworn we should do it, and so we
have.â</p>

<p>Of loyal and patriotic songs, there are enough and to
spare, but one was very popular, and therefore should be

<p>About the last caricature in this month was by I.
Cruikshank, who depicted Napoleon (July 28, 1803) as
âPreparing to invade.â He is pouring himself out a bumper,
and soliloquising, âI must take a little Dutch Courage,
for I am sure I shall never attempt it in my sober senses!
Besides, when John Bull catches me, I can plead it was
only a Drunken Frolick! Diable! if I not go, den all my
Soldiers call me one Braggadocio, and one Coward, and if
I do, begor, dey vil shew me in the Tower, as one very
Great Wild Beast.â</p>

<p>I. Cruikshank (July 28, 1803) tells us âHow to stop
an invader.â Napoleon, and his army, are represented as
having landed, and he is asking âWhich is the way to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227">227</a></span>
London?â A countryman replies, giving emphasis to his
words by driving his pitchfork deeply into the Consulâs
breast, âWhy, throâ my Body&mdash;but Iâse be throâ yourn virst.â
His wife, as a type of what was expected of the women of
England, is emptying the offensive contents of a domestic
utensil over him. Bulldogs are let loose, and are rapidly
making an end of their enemies, in which laudable enterprise
they are materially assisted by prize-fighters and
carters.</p>

<p>The month of August was very fruitful in caricature,
for in that month, and in September, the Invasion scare
was at its height.</p>

<p>There was an immense amount of Gasconading and
Braggadocio going about, as senseless as it was improbable.
Take this for example: âThe Consequence of Invasion, or
the Heroâs Reward. None but the brave deserve the fair.
The Yeomanry Cavalryâs first Essayâ (Ansell, August 1,
1803). A stout yeoman is swaggering about, with his
sword drawn, and carrying a pole, on the top of which is
Bonaparteâs head, and, lower down, he grasps some fifteen
or twenty bleeding heads of decapitated Frenchmen. He
is saying, âThere, you Rogues, there! thereâs the <i>Boney parts</i>
of them. Twenty more; Killed them!! Twenty more;
Killed them too!! I have destroyed half the army with
this same Toledo.â Women from all parts are coming to
hug and caress him, saying, âBless the Warrior that saved
our Virgin Charms.â âAh! bless him, he has saved us from
Death and Vileation.â âTake care, Iâll smother him with
kisses.â One lady says to a man, not a Volunteer: âThere
you Poltroon look how that Noble Heroâs caressed!â whilst
the poor wretch thus addressed exclaims, âOds Niggins,
I wish I had been a Soldier too, then the Girls would have
run after me, but I never could bear the smell of Gunpowder.â</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228">228</a></span>
âJohn Bull offering Little Boney fair playâ is the title
of one of Gillrayâs pictures (August 2, 1803), and depicts
the fortified coasts on both sides of the Channel, with John
Bull, as a Jack Tar, stripped to the waist for action. He
wades half across to hurl defiance at his foe. âYouâre a
coming? You be d&mdash;d! If you mean to invade us, why
make such a rout? I say little Boney, why donât you come
out? yes, d&mdash;n ye, why donât ye come out?â Meanwhile
Boney, secure in his fortress, and with his flotilla safe
on shore, looks over the parapet, and says, âIâm a coming!
Iâm a coming!!!â</p>

NAPOLEON BUONAPARTE.<br />
<br />

And unexampled depravity of Mind,<br />
Was permitted to scourge the Earth, for a Time,<br />
With all the Horrors of War:<br />
Too ignorant, and incapable, to do good to Mankind,<br />
The whole Force of his Mind was employed<br />
In oppressing the Weak, and plundering the Industrious:<br />
He was equally detested by all;<br />
His enemies he butchered in cold Blood;<br />
And fearing to leave incomplete the Catalogue of his Crimes,<br />
His friends he rewarded with a poisonâd Chalice.<br />
He was an Epitome<br />
Of all that was vicious in the worst of Tyrants;<br />
He possessâd their Cruelty, without their Talents;<br />
Their Madness, without their Genius;<br />
The Baseness of one, and the Imbecility of another.<br />
Providence, at last,<br />
Wearied out with his Crimes,<br />
Returned him to the Dunghill from which he sprung;<br />
After having held him forth<br />
On the neighbouring Gibbet,<br />
As a Scare-crow to the Invaders of the British Coast.<br />
This Beach,<br />
The only Spot in our Isle polluted by his footsteps;<br />
This Dunghill<br />
All that remains to him of his boasted Conquest.<br />
Briton!<br />
Ere you pass by<br />
Kneel and thank thy God,<br />
For all the Blessings of thy glorious Constitution;<br />
Then return unto the peaceful Bosom of thy Family, and continue<br />
In the Practice of those Virtues,<br />
By which thy Ancestors<br />
Merited the Favor of the Almighty.</p>

<p>I. Cruikshank, in âJohnny Bull giving Boney a Pullâ
(August 7, 1803), brought out a caricature in which is
graphically depicted the total annihilation of the French<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230">230</a></span>
flotilla, and John Bull is dragging Napoleon, by a cord round
his neck, to a gallows, surrounded by people waving their
hats in token of joy. Napoleon, not unnaturally, hangs
back, remarking, âAh! Misericordi! Ah! Misericordi! Jean
Bool, Jean Bool, hanging not good for Frenchmen.â But
John pulls along manfully, exclaiming, âI shant <i>measure
the Cord</i>, you F&mdash;&mdash;. I am sure it is long enough for a
dozen such Fellows as you.â</p>

<p>A picture by West (August 8, 1803), âResolutions in
case of an Invasion,â is divided into six compartments. A
tailor, with his shears, says, âIâll trim his skirts for him.â A
barber, âIâll lather his wiskers.â An apothecary, with a
pestle and mortar, âIâll pound him.â A cobbler, âIâll strap
his Jacket.â A publican, âIâll cool his Courage in a pot of
Brown Stout.â An epicure, âIâll eat him.â</p>

<p>The punishment, for any attempt at invasion, was prophesied
as being his certain downfall, and a nameless artist
(August 12, 1803) produced an engraving of âA rash attempt,
and woful downfallâ&mdash;Bonaparte snatching at the
British Crown.</p>

<p>âObservations upon Stiltsâ is by an unknown artist
(August 12, 1803), and represents Bonaparte upon a huge
pair of stilts. He is looking, over to England, through a
telescope, and is saying, âHow very diminutive everything
appears from this astonishing elevation. Who is that little<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231">231</a></span>
man, I wonder, on the Island, the other side the ditch? he
seems to be watching my motions.â John Bull, the person
referred to, is also using his telescope, exclaiming, âWhy
surely that canât be Bonny, perchâd up in that manner.
Rabbit him! if he puts one of his Poles across here, Iâll
soon lighten his timbers.â</p>

<p>âHarlequin Invasionâ is by West (August 12, 1803).
Napoleon is a Harlequin, and points with his wooden sword
âInvincibleâ to Great Britain, which is surrounded by goodly
ships of war. Pantaloon, as the Pope, typifying Italy, lies
dead, and Holland, dressed as a Pierrot, does not relish the

<p>Woodward (August 13, 1803) illustrated a very amusing
little ballad. The picture is simple. Napoleon, as usual,
with an enormous cocked hat and sword. John Bull, of
ample rotundity, with his oaken cudgel. It is called âJohn
Bull and Bonaparte!! to the tune of the Blue Bells of
Scotland.</p>

<p>In June of this year, Bonaparte, and Josephine, took a
tour into Belgium, and the CÃ´tes du Nord. What it was
like, cannot better be told than in the words of De Bourrienne.
âBonaparte left Paris on June 3: and, although
it was not for upwards of a year afterwards, that his brow
was encircled with the imperial diadem, everything connected
with the journey, had an imperial air. It was
formerly the custom, when the kings of France entered the
ancient capital of Picardy, for the town of Amiens to offer
them, in homage, some beautiful swans. Care was taken
to revive this custom, which pleased Bonaparte greatly, because
it was treating him like a king. The swans were
accepted, and sent to Paris, to be placed in the basin of the
Tuileries, in order to show the Parisians, the royal homage
which the First Consul received, when absent from the
Capital.â So it was all through his progress. The caricature
here described is, of course, exaggerated, but it shows the
feeling which animated the popular breast on this particular
journey.</p>

<p>âBoney at Brusselsâ is by I. Cruikshank (August 14,
1803), and here he is represented seated on a throne, with
a Mameluke, armed with sword and pistol, on each side of
him. He is provided with a huge fork in each hand, with
which he is greedily feeding himself from dishes provided
in the most humble and abject manner by all kinds of
great dignitaries.</p>

<p>He has his mouth full of an âAddress to the Deified<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240">240</a></span>
Consul.â The next morsel, which is on one of the forks, is
âTo the Grand Consular Deity,â and the other fork is dug well
into âWe burn with desire to lick the Dust of your Deified
feet.â A prelate begs him to âAccept the Keys of Heaven
and Hell;â and other dishes are labelled âAct of Submission,â
âYour most abject Slave, Terror of France,â and âThe
Idol of our Hearts, Livers, Lights, Guts, and Garbage,
Souls and all.â</p>

<p>âJohn Bull out of all Patience!!â is by Roberts (August
16, 1803), and represents him in a Cavalry uniform, and a
most towering rage, astride of the British Lion, which is
swimming across to France. He is shouting out, âIâll be
after you, my lads&mdash;do you think Iâll stay at home waiting
for you? If you mean to come, d&mdash;n it, why donât you
come? do you think I put on my regimentals for nothing?â
Boney and his army are running away, the former calling
out âDat is right my brave Friends, take to your heels, for
here is dat dam Jean Bool coming over on his Lion.â</p>

<p>The subjoined illustration also does duty for âThe Sorrows
of Boney, or Meditations in the Island of Elba, April,
15, 1814,â but, having priority, it appears here <span class="locked">as:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>INVASION SQUIBS, <i>continued</i>&mdash;THE BOTTLE CONJUROR&mdash;PIDCOCKâS
MENAGERIE.</p></blockquote>

<p>In order to understand the next caricature, it is necessary
to go back to January 16, 1749, when a famous hoax
was played on the public. The âGentlemanâs Magazineâ for
that month says, âA person advertised that he would, this
evening, at the <i>Theatre</i> in the <i>Hay-market</i>, play on a common
walking cane the music of every instrument now used,
to surprising perfection; that he would, on the stage, get
into a tavern quart bottle, without equivocation; and while
there, sing several songs, and suffer any spectator to handle
the bottle; that, if any spectator should come maskâd, he
would, if requested, declare who they were; that, in a private
room, he would produce the representation of any
person dead, with which the party requesting it could converse
some minutes as if alive, &amp;c.â</p>

<p>The bait took, and the theatre was crowded: patience
was exhausted, and some one in the pit calling out that
âFor double prices, the conjurer will go into a pint bottle,â
an uproar began, which ended in the wreckage of the house,
which was made into a bonfire outside, and the carrying
off of the treasury.</p>

<p>With this introduction we can the better understand
âBritannia blowing up the Corsican Bottle-Conjurer,â by
I. Cruikshank (August 17, 1803), which represents Napoleon
being violently ejected into the air, in an extremely<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245">245</a></span>
disorganised condition, from the mouth of a bottle which
is labelled âBritish Spirits composed of True Liberty,
Courage, Loyalty and Religion,â and in which is seated
Britannia, helmed, and armed with spear and shield.</p>

<p>Woodward designed âThe Corsican Mothâ (August 22,
1803), which, flying towards the candle, exclaims: âIt is a
very fierce flame; I am afraid I shall singe my wings!â
George III. consoles himself with: âThou little contemptible
insect, I shall see thee consumed by-and-by.â</p>

  <div class="caption">THE HANDWRITING ON THE WALL.</div></div>

<p>This very vivid caricature explains itself. The French
Court are consuming all the good things to be got by the
invasion of England in anticipation, when the fearful
âMene, Mene, Tekel Upharsin,â the mystic handwriting on
the wall, appears. Napoleon is in consternation, but his
wife and the assembled guests do not seem to notice it.
Josephine is here, as generally, depicted as being very fat.
She was not so at this time, nor for some time after.
Madame Junot says: âI observed that Josephine had
grown very stout since the time of my departure from
Spain. This change was at once for the better and the
worse. It imparted a more youthful appearance to her
face; but her elegant and slender figure, which had been
one of her principal attractions, had entirely disappeared.
She was now decidedly <i>embonpoint</i>, and her figure had
assumed that matronly air which we find in the statues of
Agrippina, Cornelia, &amp;c.â The three ladies behind her
chair are supposed to represent Pauline, who was afterwards
the Princess Borghese, the Princess Louise, and the
Princess Joseph Bonaparte.</p>

<p>âA Knock Down blow in the Ocean, or Bonaparte
taking French leave,â is by some unknown artist (August
24, 1803). John Bull, stripped to the waist in true pugilistic
style, has encountered Bonaparte in the Channel, and,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247">247</a></span>
with one well-directed blow, has sunk him, leaving only
his hat and boots to tell the tale. With great satisfaction
the old man says: âThere, my lad, I think that blow will
settle the business. D&mdash;n me, he is gone in such a
hurry he has left his hat and spurs behind him.â The
English give ringing cheers: âJohn Bull for ever! Huzza!
Huzza! Bravo! Bravo!â But the French look very rueful,
and, wringing their hands and weeping, exclaim: âAh!
misericorde, pauvre Bonaparte. O dat Terrible Jean
Bool.â</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">London</span>, <i>10 Thermidor&mdash;Year&mdash;&mdash;</i>.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>General <span class="smcap">Bonaparte</span> made his public entrance into the capital,
over London Bridge, upon a charger from his <span class="smcap">Britannic Majestyâs</span>
Stables at Hanover, preceded by a detachment of Mamelukes.
He stopped upon the bridge for a few seconds, to survey the
number of ships in the river; and, beckoning to one of his Aid-de-camps,
ordered the French flags to be hoisted above the
English&mdash;the English sailors on board, who attempted to resist
the execution of this order, were bayonetted, and thrown overboard.</p>

<p>When he came to the Bank, he smiled with complaisance
upon a detachment of French grenadiers, who had been sent to
load all the bullion in waggons, which had previously been put in
requisition by the Prefect of London, Citizen <span class="smcap">Mengaud</span>, for the
purpose of being conveyed to France. The Directors of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248">248</a></span>
Bank were placed under a strong guard of French soldiers, in the
Bank parlour.</p>

<p>From the Bank, the <span class="smcap">First Consul</span> proceeded, in grand procession,
along Cheapside, St. Paulâs, Ludgate Hill, Fleet Street,
and the Strand, to St. Jamesâs Palace. He there held a grand
Circle, which was attended by all his officers, whose congratulations
he received upon his entrance into the Capital of these once
proud islanders. <span class="smcap">Bonaparte</span>, previous to his arrival, appointed
two Prefects, one for London, and one for Westminster. Citizen
<span class="smcap">Mengaud</span>, late Commissary at Calais, is the Prefect of London,
and Citizen <span class="smcap">Rapp</span>, of Westminster. He also nominated Citizen
FouchÃ© to the office of Minister of Police. The Mansion-house
has been selected for the residence of the Prefect of London, and
Northumberland House for the residence of the Prefect of Westminster.
As it has been deemed necessary to have the Minister
of Police always near the person of the <span class="smcap">First Consul</span>, Marlborough
House has been given to Citizen FouchÃ©. Lodgings have been
prepared elsewhere, for the late owners of that splendid Palace.</p>

<p>London was ordered to be illuminated, and detachments of
French Dragoons paraded the principal streets, and squares, all
night.</p></blockquote>

<p>This surprising Animal was taken by Admiral <span class="smcap">John Bull</span>,
of the <span class="smcap">True Briton</span>, one of his Majestyâs principal Line of Battle
Ships. He possesses the Cunning of the Fox, the Rapacity of the
Wolf, the bloodthirsty <i>Nater</i> of the Hyena, the tender Feelings of
the Crocodile, and the Obstinacy of an Ass. He has rambled
over several parts of the world, where he played a number of
wicked and ridiculous Tricks, particularly in Egypt; there he had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252">252</a></span>
like to have been <i>nabbed</i> by Sir Sidney Smith, but contrived to
steal away to France, where, after a Time, exerting all the bad
Qualities he possesses, he so far got the better of his own species
as to reign King Paramount over Thirty Millions of poor deceived
Monkeys. âCome, come, Jacko; donât look Melancholy, you

Devil and Doctor Faustus with your Wives and <i>Darters</i>; eat
your Provisions, steal your Goods and Chattels, and commit more
Mischief here, than he did in Egypt. Heâs of unbounded Ambition,
and, by some fortunate Strokes of good Luck, more than by
his Abilities, proved very successful in his Deceptions; but this
Luck was not to last for ever. Pufât up, as full as a blown bladder,
with conceit, he thought he <i>coud</i> conquer the four Quarters of the
Globe: when, sailing with a party of large Baboons, who were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253">253</a></span>
called his body Guard, he stole, one dark Night, out of Boulogne
Harbour, to make an attack, and seize the Island of Great Britain;
where he assured his Companions of immense Wealth by their
Plunders. But Admiral BULL coming up with him by break of
day, when he was half Seas over, gave them a Broad Side, and
<i>woud</i> have sunk them outright; but seeing the Crew were nothing
but a Collection of miserable, deluded, poor, Brutes, he turned
them adrift, and only seized their Leader to shew him as a
<i>Curiosity</i>.<a id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">84</a></p></blockquote>

<p>A suggestion was made that two could play at the
game of Invasion, and âJohn Bull landed in Franceâ is a
caricature by West (August 29, 1803). He is in cavalry
uniform, and, mounted on his lion, is pursuing the French
troops, who, bestriding frogs, are in full flight. The terrible
old man roars out, âD&mdash;m me, but Iâll put your Cavalry
to the hop&mdash;I only wish I could find out your Commander.â
But Boney is looking out of a cottage chimney, remarking,
âMercy on me, what a terrible fellow. I think I am tolerably
safe here!â</p>

<p>West (August, 1803) describes the âThree plagues of
Europe.â Bonaparte figures as âThe Turberlent Mr. Fightallâ;
Pitt as âThe Honourable Mr. Taxallâ; and the Devil
as âThe Worshipful Mr. Takeall.â</p>

<p>Reference is made to Napoleonâs attempts to stir up
sedition in Ireland in âAn attempt on the Potatoe bag,â
by some artist unknown (August 1803). It shows an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258">258</a></span>
Irishman trudging along towards Dublin, having on his
back a huge sack of potatos, which Napoleon is slitting,
allowing the potatos to escape. Says Bonaparte: âI say,
Paddy, Give up the bag quietly, and you shall have this
Purse of Gold.â But Paddy replies: âI see what you are
at, you sly Teaf of the World; you may cut out a few of
the Potatoes that are rotten at the core&mdash;but, by St.
Patrick, youâll never get the whole bag&mdash;so you may
pocket your Cash, and march home and be D&mdash;d.â</p>

<p>Dean Swiftâs âGulliverâ is very frequently used as a
<i>motif</i> for caricature, and Charles etched (August 1803)
âGulliver and his Guide, or a Check String to the Corsican.â
King George, as King of Brobdingnag, is seated in a
gallery, looking through the invariable glass at Gulliver
(Napoleon), who is climbing a flight of steps to get at him;
but he has a rope round his neck, which is held by a sailor
armed with a stout oak cudgel. Says the King: âAy,
what! what! Does the little Gulliver want my C *** n!
Let him come, and he will soon find how âtis protected.
Hearts of oak are our ships, Jolly tars are our men, &amp;c.
&amp;c.â Napoleon, throttled by the rope, exclaims: âIf these
fellows did not keep such a tight hand over me, I would
soon try how that Ornament would fit my head.â Whilst
the sailor, who has him in hand and checks his advance,
calls out: âAvast there, my little fellow; for, D&mdash;n my
Timbers, if I donât take you Aback before you reach the
end of your Intended travels. So pull away, pull away, I
say, for the tight little bit of land in the Ocean.â</p>

<p>There is a charming libel on Napoleon in a periodical
publication, called âRing the Alarum Bell,â No. 3, August 27,
1803 (I believe it only reached four numbers), the heading
of which is, âAtrocities of Brutus Napoleone Ali BuonapartÃ©,
who now pretends to be at war for restoring the
Knights of Malta, and who told the Egyptiansâ (July 1798),<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_259">259</a></span>
âthat he was a true Mussulman, and had been to Malta, on
purpose to drive from thence those Christian Infidels, the
Knights!!!â</p>

<p>After a most scurrilous and incorrect version of his life,
this precious paper gives us a thrilling account of â<i>The
Corsicanâs Drowning his own wounded Soldiers, and his
Thievery</i>.</p>

<p>âDuring the early engagements at Mantua with General
Wurmsur, the hospital for the French who were wounded
was at Como. Some officers, who are ready to swear to
the truth of their assertion, passing through this town in
the month of April 1800, were informed by the inhabitants
that one morning they beheld, with unspeakable horror,
the dead bodies of a number of French soldiers floating
upon the surface of the lake, whom this infamous assassin,
BuonapartÃ©, had ordered to be cast into it on the preceding
night. Every one of these unfortunate wretches
were soldiers who had suffered amputation of some member
or other! This monster caused, at the same time, not only
the dead, but even the sick, in the hospitals to be thrown
pell-mell into a ditch at Salo, on the Lake of Guarda. It
is a fact, well-known in Upper Italy, that the Curate of
Salo died with grief at the sight of this horrible transaction.</p>

<p>âThe pecuniary robberies of the Corsican are innumerable.
At Leghorn he caused a servant of the Grand Duke
to bring him all the plate belonging to that Prince, and
kept himself an inventory, in order to examine whether
any article was missing. At Pisa a British nobleman (the
Marquis of D&mdash;&mdash;) was robbed of his carriage, and other
effects, by a party of French Hussars. Buonaparte appropriated
the carriage to himself, and afterwards made use of
it at Milan. France was then in a state of profound peace
with the Grand Duke. At Milan, Buonaparte imprisoned<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_260">260</a></span>
the Nobles, and, in order to procure their release, their consorts
brought their diamonds to the wife of the Usurper.â</p>

<p>âThe Alertness of our People, employed in the several
Yards along the Coasts, never had a parallel. I reckon 11,000
Ship-Carpenters, and their necessary Assistants, Labourers,
&amp;c., employed here, and at <i>Calais</i>, <i>Dunkirk</i>, and <i>Ostend</i>, besides
those at Work on the Boats preparing at <i>Ghent</i>, <i>Bruges</i>, and
<i>Antwerp</i>.</p>

<p>âAt <i>Boulogne</i>, we have 36 Gun Boats ready, each carrying
three heavy Pieces of Ordnance, Two fore, and One aft; besides
152 of what are called <i>Flat Bottomed</i> Boats; but they
are now generally <i>rounded below</i>, and <i>keeled</i>. In three Weeks
Time, we expect to have as many more in a State of perfect
Readiness.</p>

<p>âAt <i>Calais</i>, several of the <i>Floating Batteries</i>, that opposed <span class="smcap">Lord
Nelson</span>, when he attacked Boulogne, are now fitting up, and
about seventy boats that will carry 150 Men each.</p>

<p>âAt <i>Dunkirk</i>, and the adjacent Canals, there are 47 <i>Gun
boats ready</i>, with remarkable heavy Ordnance; and not less
than 220 Boats for carrying men. They count upon being able
to send 400 of these vessels (great and small) to Sea, in less than
Three Weeks.</p>

<p>âAt <i>Ostend</i>, the <i>Gun Boats</i>, <i>Floating Batteries</i>, and <i>Vessels for
carrying Soldiers</i>, that are now, and will be, completed during the
present month, amount to 487. They work here during the Whole
of the Moonlight nights.</p>

<p>âI cannot, at present, exactly ascertain what Number of Men<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_264">264</a></span>
are employed, at <i>Bruges</i> and <i>Ghent</i>; but they are extremely
numerous. Such is the case at Antwerp.â</p></blockquote>

<p>But not one of these vessels dared shew her nose out of
harbour, for every French port in the Channel was blockaded
by English men-of-war, of which there were some five
hundred, of different sizes, afloat. Sometimes this blockading
business got tiresome, and it was relieved by an
occasional landing, on which occasions mischief to the
French, in some shape or other, was always included in the
programme; or a vessel would be cut out, or a few shells
would be thrown into a town such as Dieppe or Havre&mdash;anything
to vary the monotony. At home they were bragging
and blustering of what they would do; afloat they
were <i>doing</i>, and we cannot tell from what fate their action
saved us.</p>

<p>Woodward drew an amusing sketch of âJohn Bull
shewing the Corsican monkeyâ (September 3, 1803), who
is represented as seated on a Russian bear, which is muzzled
and led by John Bull, who thus expatiates on his charge to
the delighted audience: âMy friends and neighbours, this
is no monkey of the common order; he is a very cholerick
little gentleman, I assure you. I had a vast deal of trouble
to bring him to any kind of obedience&mdash;he is very fond of
playing with globes and scepters&mdash;so you may perceive, I
let him have one of each made of Gingerbread&mdash;in order to
amuse him in a strange country.â</p>

<p>A not very witty picture, âBuonaparte on his Ass,â
by an unknown artist (September 14, 1803), represents
Bonaparte on a donkey, which has got itself in a terrible
mess through trampling on Italy, Switzerland, Holland,
and Hanover, and is endeavouring to reach Malta, which,
however, is protected by the British Lion. Napoleon
opines that, âThis d&mdash;d ass gets so entangled and unruly,
Iâm afraid I shall never be able to reach Malta.â</p>

<p>INVASION SQUIBS, <i>continued</i>&mdash;TALLEYRANDâS DISINCLINATION TO
INVADE ENGLAND.</p></blockquote>

<p>âA full and particular Account of the Trial of Napoleon
Buonaparte before John Bull,â drawn by Woodward,
etched by Cruikshank (September 14, 1803), is a broadside
not remarkable for artistic merit; it does not even give
a fair idea of Napoleonâs features. The letterpress is as
<span class="locked">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>The Court being opened, and John Bull on the bench,
Napoleon Buonaparte was put to the Bar, charged with various
high crimes, thieving, and misdemeanours. Counsellor Tell
Truth opened the case on the part of the prosecution, as follows:</p>

<p><i>Counsellor.</i> May it please your worship Mr. John Bull, and
Gentlemen of the Jury, From the Indictment now before you,
you will perceive the prisoner stands charged as follows: that he,
Napoleon Buonaparte, on the 28th of December, 1793, caused at
Toulon, when the siege was over, fifteen hundred men, women,
and children, to be fired upon with grape shot; that by these
means he became a favourite of Robespierre, and, in concert with
that destroyer, did on the 13th Vendemaire, October 4, 1795,
sweep the streets of Paris near the Pont Neuf with artillery, and
covered the steps of St. Roch with heaps of slaughtered bodies;
the persons massacred on the whole amounted to about eight
thousand. At Pavia, the magistrates having interfered to save
the people from the bayonet, were bound together, and shot by
his order; he also burnt the town of Benasco, and massacred the
inhabitants. At Alexandria he gave up the city to his soldiers for
four hours; the old people, women, and children, flew to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_267">267</a></span>
mosques, but the mosques were no protection from brutal fury,
though Buonaparte professed himself a Turk;&mdash;at Jaffa, horrid to
relate! three thousand eight hundred prisoners were marched
to a rising ground, and there destroyed by means of musquetry,
grape shot, and the bayonet; in short, his various massacres,
robberies, and pillage, are too numerous to bring forward. I shall
only observe, that this gentle, this merciful man, at the above
place, Jaffa, finding his hospitals crowded with sick of his own
army, caused the whole to be poisoned; thus, in a few hours, five
hundred and eighty soldiers died miserably by order of their
General&mdash;; so says Sir Robert Wilson.</p>

<p><i>John Bull.</i> Mercy on me, Mr. Tell Truth, let me hear no
more, it will lift my wig off with horror!!!</p>

<p><i>Counsellor T.&nbsp;T.</i> I shall briefly observe, that this man, after
overrunning all Italy, France, Holland, Switzerland, stealing our
beloved Georgeâs horses at Hanover, and various other sacrifices
to his unbounded ambition, had the audacity to declare he would
invade the happy shores of Great Britain, and disturb the fireside
of honest John Bull and his children; but he was stopped in his
career by a single English seaman, who will lay the particulars
before the Court. Crier, call in Tom Mizen.</p>

<p><i>Crier.</i> Tom Mizen, come into Court.</p>

<p><i>John Bull.</i> Now, Mister Mizen, what have you to say?</p>

<p><i>Tom Mizen.</i> You must know, Mr. Bull, having, as it were,
lashed myself to a love of my King and Country, and hearing the
land lubber at the bar was about to bring over his Cock boats;
I thought myself, in duty bounden, to see what sort of game he
was after; so, rigging out my little skiff the Buxom Kitty, I
clapped a few pounders aboard, with an allowance of grog, and
set sail; when I got near Bull-hog-ney&mdash;I think they call it so in
their palaver&mdash;but I never can think of their outlandish palaver,
not I&mdash;howsomdever I soon spied a little gun boat or two, and on
board one of them I saw a little pale-faced olive-coloured man in
a large cocked hat, taking measure of the sides: may I never set
sail again, said I, if that is not little Boney&mdash;so I made no more
ado, but got ready my cordage and grappling irons, and after one
broadside, towed the little gentleman into Brighton.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_268">268</a></span>
<i>John Bull.</i> Bravo, Mister Mizen&mdash;now let us hear what
Mynheer Dutchman has to say.</p>

<p><i>Dutchman.</i> Indeed, Mynheer Bool, I have nothing to say in
his favour&mdash;he has robbed me of my liberty, my money, and
everything that is dear to me.</p>

<p><i>Italian.</i> I am precisely in the same position.</p>

<p><i>Swiss.</i> And I.</p>

<p><i>The Pope.</i> I once had a voice in the senate, but he has totally
abridged my power.</p>

<p><i>Hanoverian, &amp;c.</i> We are one and all tired of his tyrannical
usurpation.</p>

<p><i>John Bull.</i> Then it appears to me no one will speak in his
favour.</p>

<p><i>From the Court.</i> Not one.</p>

<p><i>John Bull.</i> Well then&mdash;what has the prisoner to say in his
own defence?</p>

<p><i>Buonaparte.</i> I am a man of few words, and leave my defence,
entirely to my counsel.</p>

<p><i>The Devil, as Counsellor for the Prisoner.</i> Mr. Bull, and
Gentlemen of the Jury, I blush for the first time in my life; it is
well known I am the father of lies and mischief, and have had the
prisoner at the bar a considerable time in training, but he really
goes so much beyond my abilities, that I entirely give up to the
discretion of the Jury.</p>

<p><i>John Bull.</i> I shall very briefly, gentlemen, sum up the
evidence; you have heard a long and serious detail of the
prisonerâs cruelties in different parts of the world. The conduct
of our worthy countryman, Tom Mizen, you must all admire;
you perceive there is not one person to speak in his favour; and
even his old counsel the Devil will have nothing to do with him&mdash;I
therefore leave him to your verdict.</p>

<p>The Jury, without leaving the Court, pronounced the prisoner
<i>Guilty</i>.</p>

<p class="center">
John Bull then passed sentence, as follows:
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Napoleon Buonaparte</span>&mdash;after a fair trial, you have been
found guilty of various high crimes and misdemeanours, in different
parts of this world. I am a man that delights not in blood;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_269">269</a></span>
I therefore sentence you to be turned over to the care of my trusty
and beloved friend Mr. Pidcock, proprietor of the Wild beasts
over Exeter âChange in the Strand; there to be publicly shewn to
my fellow citizens, inclosed in an iron cage for three months;
after the expiration of which time, I sentence you to be transported
to your native town of Ajaccio in Corsica for three months,
and, for the remainder of your life, to be hung up by your legs in
the mines of Mexico.</p>

<p>Mr. Pidcock attended with a cage, and disposed of the
prisoner according to his sentence; he appeared extremely
hardened during the whole of the trial. The Court was uncommonly
crowded.</p></blockquote>

<p>âThe Fable of the Bundle of Faggots exemplified, or

conquered nations, but this is too hard a job for him, as
he confesses: âAu diable! all I can do, theyâll neither

<p>It is well known that Talleyrand was averse to the intended
invasion of England, and some time in September
1803, Gillray produced âThe Corsican Carcase Butcherâs
Reckoning Day, New Style, <i>No Quarter</i> Day!â a portion of
which is here given. Talleyrand (his ecclesiastical status
expressed by the cross on his partially military cocked hat)
restrains Napoleon from invading England, although the
Conqueror has on his seven-league boots. In the distance
are the white cliffs of Albion, surrounded by ships of war,
and a huge bull bellows defiance. At the open door the
Russian bear looks in, enraging Napoleon almost to frenzy.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_272">272</a></span>
On the ground is a coop full of foxes labelled âFrom Rome,
not worth killing.â âThe Germanic Bodyâ lies in a sadly
mutilated condition, having lost its head, feet, and hands;
one of the latter&mdash;the right hand&mdash;lies close by, labelled
âHanover.â A poor, lean, gaunt dog, âPrussia,â is in a
kennel âput up to fatten.â The food provided for it is
blood, or âConsular Whipt Syllabub.â In a trough lie the
bodies of six Mamelukes, âJaffa Cross breeds,â whose
blood drains into a receptacle âGlory.â On the walls are

<p>âThe Corsican Locustâ (West, September 1803) shows
him hovering over a picnic party, saying: âBless me,
how comfortably these People live.â The party consists
of an Englishman, Irishman, and a Scotchman. The
first has roast beef, plum-pudding, and a foaming tankard,
before him, and, regarding the insect, says: âAs sure as Iâm
alive, that Corsican locust smells the Roast Beef and
Plumb pudding.â Paddy has only âpraties,â but looks up
at it, and asks: âPerhaps, my Jewel, âtis a potatoe or two
you want, but the divil a halfpeth do you get from me.â
The Scotchman, with his basin and spoon in his hands,
thinks: âPerhaps the Cheeld would like a little oâ my
Scotch Broth&mdash;but Sandy is too cunning for that.â</p>

<p>âThe Grand Triumphal Entry of the Chief Consul into
Londonâ is by an unknown artist (October 1, 1803). He
is escorted by volunteer cavalry, and is seated, bareheaded
and handcuffed, with his face towards the tail of a white
horse,<a id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">86</a> his legs being tied under its belly. The horse is led
by two volunteers, one of whom carries a flagstaff with the
tricolour under the Union Jack, and on the summit is
perched Boneyâs huge hat, labelled âFor Saint Pauls.â One
of the mob is calling out: âWe may thank our Volunteers
for this glorious sight.â</p>

<p>An unknown artist (October 11, 1803) gives us âThe
Ballance of Power or the Issue of the Contest.â The hand
of Providence is holding the balance, and John Bull, whose
good qualities are named âValour, Justice, Honor, Integrity,
Commerce, Firmness, Trade, Heroism, Virtue,â is
rapidly ascending; and, according to his own account,
âThereâs a sweet little Cherub that sits up aloft, will take<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_282">282</a></span>
care of the fate of John Bull. But poor Boney, with a
heavy burden on his back of âShame, Disgrace, Obloquy,
Cruelty, Murder, Plunder, Rapine, Villainy, and Hypocrisy,â
is sinking into the earth, which emits flames to consume
him.</p>

<p>âThoughts on Invasion, both sides the water,â by
Charles (October 11, 1803), shows us the English coast
defended by volunteers. John Bull, laughing, is seated in
a chair, under which is a cornucopia, running over with
corn, wine, beef, and all kinds of provisions. The old boy
is chuckling: âI canât help laughing at the thought of Invasion,
but there is no knowing what a mad man may
attempt, so Iâll take care to have my coast well lined, and
I think 80,000 such men as me, able to eat all the Boney
rascals in France, and if they mean Invasion, I have sent
a Specimen of Bombs into Calais!â The ships are shown
in the act of bombarding that place, while Boney sits very
miserable, with a tricolour foolscap on his head, moaning:
âI wish I had never promisâd to Invade this terrible John
Bull, but how shall I avoid it, with Credit to myself and
honour to the French Nation? and this bombarding Calais
gives me the Bl&mdash;&mdash; Blu&mdash;&mdash; Blue Devils.â A blue devil
behind him is saying: âYou must go now, Boney, as sure
as I shall have you in the end.â</p>

<p>âThe little Princess and Gulliverâ is by Ansell (October
21, 1803), and, of course, the Gulliver is Napoleon, whom a
Brobdingnagian princess (Charlotte of Wales) has plunged
into a basin of water, and, with her fist, keeps beating him
as he rises to the top, saying: âThere you impertinent,
boasting, swaggering pigmy&mdash;take that. You attempt to
take my Grandpapaâs Crown indeed, and plunder all his
subjects; Iâll let you know that the Spirit and Indignation
of every Girl in the Kingdom is roused at your
Insolence.â</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_283">283</a></span>
âThe Centinel at his Post, or Boneyâs peep into Walmer
Castle!!â (Ansell, October 22, 1803) shows Boney, with a
boat-load of troops, arrived on the English Coast, but they
are at once disconcerted by the appearance of the sentinel,
Pitt, who challenges, âWho goes there?â With abject fear
depicted on the countenance of Bonaparte and his followers,
the former exclaims: âAh! Begar&mdash;dat man alive
still. Turn about, Citoyens&mdash;for there will be no good
to be done&mdash;I know his tricks of old!!â</p>

<p>There are two caricatures on the same subject, one
attributed to Gillray, but signed C.L.S. (October 25, 1803),
the other by I. Cruikshank, to which the same date is
attributed. One is evidently copied from the other, for the
<i>motif</i> is the same in both. I prefer the former, and therefore
describe it. It is called âFrench Volunteers marching
to the Conquest of Great Britain, dedicated (by an Eye
Witness) to the Volunteers of Great Britain.â A mounted
officer leads a gang of chained, handcuffed, and pinioned,
scarecrow-looking conscripts, some of them so weak that
they have to be carried in paniers on donkey-back, or
drawn on a trolley; whilst a poor, dilapidated, ragged
wretch, also chained by the neck, and with his hands tied
behind him, brings up the rear of the procession.</p>

<p>âJohn Bull guarding the Toy Shopâ (J.&nbsp;B., October 29,
1803) shows a shop-window containing such toys as the
India House, St. Jamesâs, the Bank, Custom House, Tower,
and the Treasury. Little Boney, with his handkerchief to
his eyes, is weeping, and crying: âPray, Mr. Bull, let me
have some of the Toys, if âtis only that little one in the
Cornerâ (the Bank). But John Bull, who is in full regimentals,
and armed with his gun, replies, in his rough,
insular way: âI tell you, you shanât touch one of them&mdash;so
blubber away and be <span class="locked">d&mdash;d.â</span></p>

<p>The volunteer force was a great factor in face of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_284">284</a></span>
Invasion, and it was computed to number 350,000 men.<a id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">87</a>
We know, in our own times, that, at a mere whisper of invasion,
men enrolled themselves as volunteers by thousands,
and we have never heard that whisper repeated. The
enthusiasm of the citizen army was very great, and twice
in October 1803 (on the 26th 14,500 men, and on the 28th
about 17,000), the King reviewed these volunteers in Hyde
Park. It will be curious briefly to note some particulars
respecting the pay and clothing of volunteers. They are
taken from the circular papers of regulations which were
sent from Lord Hobartâs office to the Lords Lieutenant of
the different counties.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>8. When not called out on actual service, constant pay to be
allowed for 1 Sergeant and 1 Drummer per Company, at the same
rates as in the disembodied Militia; the pay of the Drummer to
be distributed at the discretion of the Commandant; pay (as disembodied
Militia) for the rest of the Sergeants and Drummers,
and for the Corporals and private men, to be allowed for two days
in the week, from the 25th of February to the 24th of October,
and for one day in the week from the 25th day of October to the
24th of February, both inclusive, being 85 days pay per annum, but
for effectives only, present under arms, on each respective day.
Pay may, however, be charged for persons absent by sickness, for
a period not exceeding three months, on the Commanding Officerâs
Certificate to that effect. Sergeants 1/6, Corporals Â½, Drummers
and Privates 1/.</p>

<p>9. If a Corps, or any part thereof, shall be called upon, in case
of any riot or disturbance, the charge of constant pay to be made
for such services must be at the rates before specified, and must
be supported by a Certificate from his Majestyâs Lieutenant, or
the Sheriff of the County; but, if called out in case of actual
Invasion, the Corps is to be paid and disciplined in all respects as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_285">285</a></span>
the Regular Infantry, the Artillery Companies excepted, which
are then to be paid as the Royal Artillery.</p>

<p>10. The whole to be clothed in Red, with the exception of the
Corps of Artillery, which may have Blue clothing, and Rifle Corps,
which may have Green, with black belts.</p>

number.</p></blockquote>

<p>There is an amusing caricature (October 18, 1803) illustrating
Talleyrandâs disinclination to the projected invasion
of England.</p>

<p>In his âVoyage to Brobdingnag,â Lemuel Gulliver,
speaking of his enemy the Kingâs Dwarf, says: âHe had
before served me a scurvy trick, which set the queen a-laughing,
although at the same time she was heartily
vexed, and would have immediately cashiered him, if I
had pot been so generous as to intercede. Her majesty
had taken a marrow-bone upon her plate, and, after knocking
out the marrow, placed the bone again in the dish
erect, as it stood before; the dwarf, watching his opportunity
when Glumdalclitch was gone to the sideboard,
mounted the stool that she stood on to take care of me at
meals, took me up in both hands, and squeezing my legs<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_286">286</a></span>
together, wedged them into the marrow bone above my
waist, where I stuck for some time, and made a very ridiculous
figure. I believe it was near a minute before any
one knew what was become of me; for I thought it below
me to cry out. But, as princes seldom get their meat hot,
my legs were not scalded, only my stockings and breeches
in a sad condition. The dwarf, at my entreaty, had no
other punishment than a sound whipping.â</p>

<p>J.&nbsp;B. (November 5, 1803) produced âBoney in time for
Lord Mayors Feast.â At this banquet a sailor produces
Napoleon chained, and with a collar round his neck. He
thus introduces him: âHere he is, please your Honors.
We caught him alive, on the Suffolk Coast. He was a
little queerish at first, but a few Stripes at the Gangway
soon brought him about. I told him he was just in time
for the Lord Mayorâs Show. What does your honor think
of him for the Man in Armour?â The Lord Mayor, glass
in hand, says: âAy, you see how we live at this end of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_290">290</a></span>
town, but you get no Roast beef here, Master Boney&mdash;Let
him have plenty of Soup Maigre&mdash;and in the evening take
him up to the Ball Room for the amusement of the Ladies&mdash;Come,
heres the glorious Ninth of November.â</p>

<p>âDestruction of the French Gun Boats&mdash;or Little Boney
and his friend Talley in high Gleeâ is presumably by
Gillray, though not signed by him (November 22, 1803).
It represents the total destruction of the French flotilla by
the English fleet&mdash;which Napoleon, mounted on Talleyrandâs
shoulder, is watching with great glee through a
rolled-up paper (Talleyrandâs plan for invading Great
Britain), which is being used in lieu of a telescope. He
shouts out, in great delight, âOh my dear Talley, what a
glorious sight! Weâve worked up Johnny Bull into a fine
passion! My good fortune never leaves me! I shall now
get rid of a Hundred Thousand French Cut Throats whom
I was so afraid of! Oh, my dear Talley, this beats the
Egyptian Poisoning hollow! Bravo Johnny! pepper âem
Johnny!â</p>

<p>Ansell is answerable for âBoneyâs Journey to London,
or the reason why he is so long in coming, i.e. because he
travels like a Snail with his house at his backâ (November
23, 1803). He is portrayed as being in a wooden house,
drawn by his soldiers, who are being unmercifully whipped
with a knout-like weapon. Napoleon, calling out to the
officer who is administering the punishment, âYou Vagabones,
make haste, Vite, Vite, or I shall not get to London
by Christmass. Give them more of the Fraternal Whip,
the dam Rascals do not know the value of Liberty.â</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
